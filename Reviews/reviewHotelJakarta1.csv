ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Felicia Gunardi,3.0,"We tried this hotel cause my hubby need to do something nearby. We took junior suite 2BR while there was promotion price. The room quite big with 2 bedroom but only 1 bathroom outside the bedroom and quite old. There also kitchen and living room. It's quite clean but unfortunately I found live cockroach near the sink kitchen. They also give you obly empty jar to fill in the water dispenser outside room. The service quite oke except when in breakfast time my son want to take some food, the waiter didn't allow because need to photo it first. While the food in breakfast just usual variation but doesn't taste too good. The location is quite oke, in the middle of the busy district but it also means a lot traffic."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,M Ang,2.0,"Hotel is south area .Staff is nice But dont speak english so quite difficult to communicate.The bed is confortable but a lot of mosquitos in the room and lobby a total nightmare...No safe in the room...Breakfast is simple nothing special , no coffee machine juste bad coffee serve.for the same price I recommand Ibis much better quality ..."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Diandra Harun,1.0,The worst service experience ive ever encountered in Jkt. Asked for extra 2 pillows as my husband is sick and we are willing to pay but they refuse. Asked to speak to their manager  and waited for 15 minutes and doesnt even want to come out to see me. Wont be recommending this place to any of my family or friends in indo or malay. And im still staying here til this Sunday wish us luck 😭
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,1.2,"This is the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. I couldn't get in after checking in at night. My colleague and I went up and down the x3 times to reset the card and ended up still the same! The bed in the room was dirty and the room was dark! What's even more exaggerated is that the power supply in my room was cut off at 8am in the morning, and then the hotel receptionist told me to restart it myself! I paid at this high price to live in a place like a public toilet!"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Bella Salsha,5.0,"I was booked for Iftar Reservation at Aston Belvenue Radio Dalam, it was a great experience to enjoy Indonesian food at one time, good and pleasant service when meeting Ainul, and fast response with Rifai, to fulfill all our needs when iftar time, an unforgettable moment, thank you Aston Belvenue"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,FandiStevee,1.0,"I went to the spa just for relaxing my tired body but the therapist forced me to get happy ending massage which I don’t want to and she keep asking me for happy ending.. so if you guys looking for happy ending massage, feel free to ask the therapist."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Tabi,1.0,"They didnt change their bed sheets or somethingI have to ask for a new room twice to at least get a decent but still not the cleanest bed sheetI found a pubic hair looking thing in the 1st roomAnd in the 2nd room they gave me twin bed with sheets full of stainsNever had this kind of experience in a 4 star hotelThis brand is known for being greatBut this particular branch is not good"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Buyung Baskoro,4.0,"Room was good. Food was okay, but restaurant needed more cleanliness standard. Overall, experience was great."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,arome,2.0,"the staff are not so friendly. Most of the hotel I have booked in my whole life allow check in before 2pm, but for the first time i wait from 1:30 pm till 2pm and still need to wait for 15 min because the room is being vaccum."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Chris Andrew (Andrew),3.0,"Came here for a business meeting. The location of this hotel is very strategic, just a couple of minutes walk from a shopping center named Pondok Indah Mall (PIM). To be fair the experience was quite okay and nothing went wrong during my visit.However, in my opinion, this hotel did not meet my expectations of the ASTON brand. The main reason for this is because the food selection here is very limited and actually have a so so taste. Definitely nothing special. In addition, the pool here is very small and also car parking here is quite difficult. Not a lot of parking space and very difficult to enter as the basement ramp is very narrow."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Mario Sales,1.0,"Here I am again to review this hotel. Despiste my extremely bad experience before, due to my office location, this is the best choice to avoid endless time in traffic jams. Maybe better to accept the fact that traffic is part of daily life in Jakarta then to accept that a 4 star hotel (?????) is completly mis-functional. I am currently at the hotel and all the same problems as reported before are still there (here) although the promise of the General Manager that they would be looked at. Nothing happened in more than one month, or at least nothing visible for a guest happened. I am currently in a situation where the AC has been leaking for the whole day. Technicians were called 2 times and problem still remains, with an extra ""interesting"" addendum to the story that the ceiling is starting to crack, putting our safety at risk. Manager was called and the solution is to move to a similar room without no compensation (read, a room upgrade) to at least make a client happier (not happy) after such an unpleasant and hazzardous experience. We will start to pack all our stuff and move and then unpack in the new (read, newly assigned) room.To finalize, picking up on Mr. Benny C Karambut (General Manager): ""Should you reconsider staying with us again, we'd appreciate the opportunity to provide you with a much-improved experience that aligns with the quality and standards associated with Aston hotels"". You are far far far away from that Mr. Benny!"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Tari Zen,5.0,"Best food in the town near area pondok indah mall,with nice ambience and food and service mas Bilal was excellent.Very kind and fast"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Good location, but facilities are old. The elevator speed is slow and irritating. If you're okay with a cheap hotel, then I think it's a good hotel."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Daphne Wong A Foe (DWAF.),1.0,"Very bad experience.*You do not get treated like a customer. I had to carry all my bags and suitcases by myself (as an Indonesian-LOOKING girl), but when I was with my (bule) foreigner husband they carried his bags for him. Racists!!!*the door men/bell boys (2!!) just stood there and did not even help or open the door as it's their job - they couldn't even speak one word of English.*The lady behind the lobby desk could not speak English as well and was very rude.*On top of that I had to pay PARKING for my taxi DROP-OFF that lasted less than 1 second - and no one could explain to me why or how that would make sense in any world.
*The rooms are VERY DARK - lighting is bad, deco is old-fashioned. But one light keeps blinking on and off. Horrible when you need to sleep.
*Plus you cannot sleep as there is always music playing in the hallway.
*In the morning they CALL your room (while trying to sleep after terrible nights) to ask what time you want room service - while my sign is on ""do not disturb/no cleaning"" 🙃 When I asked why they called they couldn't answer ofcourse. Terrible headache after that!!
*The gym is one small room, with one machine.
NOT WORTH MY MONEY - I DECLARE A REFUND!!!!"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Aulia Rizkia,5.0,What a perfect place to stay and held a bridal shower event with friends! It was a extremendous night and we were surprised by the beautiful decoration in our rooms from the hotel management. Thankyou for the great services!
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,5.0,It was a good hotel! Very impressive. Plenty of shops nearby and walking distance to Pondok Indah Mall!
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,2.0,"Requested for high floor, but given 2nd floor. For 2 nights not able to available, till 3rd then move to 6th floor. Poor Bathroom design, little space to stand when closing the door and not able to close properly. Bedsheets is not very clean. The chair got a cigarette burn. Breakfast range is not good, coffee taste ok. Should be classified as 3 Stars rather than 4 Stars. Plus is the staffs and door man are friendly."

ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Pathiusman Ashiq,3.0,Decent hotel. Breakfast buffet was chaotic as the restaurant is full and the staff did not show me a table.
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Shanti Dwita Lestari,5.0,"Comfortable bed and tasty breakfast. Pros : they serve asparagus soup on breakfast buffet
Cons: salad and fruit could be improved,  already prepared in small portions, mostly lettuce and shredded carrot"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,4.0,The hotel is quite cleanGood serviceThe room is big enough for a familyWill stay here again for the same purpose 🥰
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Natharine A,3.0,A little disappointed because the closet is dirty n the hairdryer can’t working properly. The front desk don’t stand by so we must waiting to checking in. But overall good for the bed and the cleanliness. Maybe in the future the staff must double check for the room first
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Lita Shahzaman,5.0,"Very happy with the hotel , friendly staff and good food /bfast ."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,4.6,"One of the standout features was the excellent value for the price. I felt that the rates were reasonable and provided great bang for the buck, especially considering the spacious accommodations."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Teguh Bintang Nugraha,3.0,"1. Missing toothbrush amenities
2. Room wasn't ready at 2 PM as scheduled, me, my wife and my 3 month baby waiting for around 15 minutes.
3. I can't do late checkout, receptionist asked if I want to extend or not, then I answer No, then I asked can I do late checkout, she then answer they fully booked, SO WHY ASK EXTENSION IN THE FIRST PLACE IF ALREADY FULLY BOOKED ? please don't lie and just reject my late checkout request!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Rina Tanjung,5.0,"Check in desk prompt, nice and helpful. Overall the staffs are polite and proactively. Gym is considered good and spacious. Pool is small and just nice for kids to play around. Breakfast is also okay and various. No complaint on the taste. Only when we stayed, hotel was quite crowded in the restaurant and seat fully occupied for breakfast. On our last day, Ms. Dewinta came to our table during breakfast, requested politely for a guest review. With a friendly gesture, she listened to our all comments. At the end she served us with a complementary tuna sandwich. Overall this hotel is recommended, good location nearby the exit toll, parking lot is available."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Mitha Novita,5.0,"Been couple times staying in Mercure Hotel  and enjoyed the stay very much. What I like the most is the White Rock Terrace restaurant.  They serve unique pizza and I was lucky enough to try it when having business trip in Jakarta.  Cz now the menu has been out so I cannot eat it again.
But I always like the ambience of the restaurant,  very cozy and comfortable to hang out and enjoy the lunch with my friends. The nicest waitresses is Ms Abigail who is kind and patient to serve us. Definitely I will come back again for my next trip!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Danny,1.0,"I had 2 different booking for consecutive stays.
The first booking is from 22 to 24 April without breakfast. The second one is from 24 to 27 April with breakfast. I had specifically told the Front Officer to make the room 3003 continuous stay, and she said she would take care of it. 

However during my stay with my Business Partner, the FO called our room on 24 April, asking what time we would check out. After 3pm on the same day (24 April), all of our cards were inactive and I had to ask my Business Partner to help change the cards at the Receptionist. Still, on the same day, our room was knocked so loudly while we were taking a rest (read: SLEEPING), the staff asked whether we would extend or check out. Like where's the manner? 

When I checked out at the 27 April, I told the FO regarding the incidents and he casually told me that it occurred because I had 2 different bookings. Excuse me, this is not the first time I had this kind of stay (1 continuous stay with more than 1 booking and it was smooth without reactivating or changing to another keys).

Really unacceptable."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Deutsch m,5.0,"I would like to say thank you so much to Mbak Ayu for her kindness to serve us. She always gives her best so that we can feel comfortable enyoing our food. ||That is one reason why we like to spend our time here, enyoing the morning with warmth. And that is such a blessing. ||And thank you for your service too, Mbak Della. We really enjoyed our lunch. ||Keep up the good work. ||Regards|Rotua Elisabeth"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,타루,5.0,"This hotel is so good. Reasonable price, fantastic facilities and services. And also so kind all staff as well. Especially one of staff Miss Mira was so nice and professional. I strongly recommend this hotel to you. Just try to eat the various and delicious breakfast and take a rest in this hotel while you stay."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Felix L,4.0,I arrived late. Really late. This is my second stay in the hotel. The back entrance to the hotel was closed during the night so you have to drive through the front entrance. ||||Check in was smooth. The room was really wonderful. Well thought out. It had everything I needed and was super comfortable and quiet. I would choose this hotel again should I have early meeting in the area. Keep up the good work.
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Ignatius Aldo,3.0,"So far the hotel is great, but in terms of experience it can be better. I feel the staff friendliness, professionalism and attitude can be improve especially at the breakfast place, some stuff is really do the effort but some quite not so."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,astari w,4.0,"Alhamdulillah , the hotel is very good in room condition and the hospitality. The bedroom is Very roomy and clean. And Thank you to ms. Iza the front officer, very helpfull. Good work for Mercure Hotel. Hopefully we could back in here soon, insyaaAllah"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Alfred Tan,3.0,"The hotel just beside the busy highway and the room window also not sound proof, I really got problem to sleep on the first night and need to request for room change middle of the night. The second room that allocated facing another side of the highway still noisy, but at least the noise is not as heavy compared to the first room.

The coffee machine in privilege room has been removed, but their website not updated and the welcome amenities also replaced with so call executive lounge, but in actual fact it’s only a snack corner just behind the east wing lift area. The access is by using the voucher given and only 1 time access per stay as per their RDM told me.

As an Accor Plus Platinum member,  sorry to say that I don’t really recommend this hotel with this kind of room conditions."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Philly Chen,5.0,"Nice place, in the ground floor of Mercure hotel and very convenience for people staying here.
Fair price with good foods and drinks. Pizza is recommended.
Service is good and basically they all can understand English.
Tropical environment and SE asia decoration."

Always my got to hotel whenever I go to Jakarta.||The room is always cold, clean & comfy to stay with.||The staff is nice and helpful, especially Dindha at the check in counter👍🏻||The breakfast is also good, maybe even the best compare to other mercure in jakarta."

Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,masjoandyoh,5.0,"The location of the hotel was perfect for me which it was situated on heart of the city.. The check-in process was also smooth and efficient by reception staff. The hotel amenities were top-notch with high standard of cleanliness as well. Overall, my stay was an unforgettable experience and the staff's genuine hospitality makes me want return here again in the near future"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Kikita Yoshehana,5.0,"We got a very spacious room with great view, very nice interior both for the bedroom and bathroom. We really enjoy our stay here. And because we are Accor plus member, they gave us complimentary cakes and we enjoyed our welcome drink in the cafe with nice ambience. The service is also good. The location is strategic in the middle of Jakarta. Overall it’s a nice experience 😊

The only downside is the water in the swimming pool was very cold, and it’s so windy there, we cancelled our swimming plan because of that."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,M Ammar Fadhlur Rahman,4.0,"Being a regular at this hotel has only deepened my appreciation for the consistently exceptional experience it offers. From the warm welcome at the entrance to the comfortable and well-appointed rooms, the attention to detail is evident throughout. And I must commend Adzra, one of the remarkable staff member in the restaurant area. Each visit reaffirms my choice, and I can confidently recommend Mercure to anyone seeking a reliable and enjoyable stay."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Have often stayed here. The rooms are clean, room requests are fulfilled, the staff is friendly, the food is delicious, only the breakfast is really full in the morning. Sometimes there is a little leftover food that can't be refilled. The egg station waited until 15 minutes before the eggs were ready. Maybe it was so busy at breakfast. Thank you Mercure Gatsu"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Chaterin Leao,5.0,"Perfect ! Can see them suffering from above in those traffic while I’m enjoying the pool, and the gym 😂😂. Nice view , comfy bed , had massage lady came to my hotel was the best decision as well, service was good ! Just the front office guys were very cold . But the security, and other staff are friendly! The location is okay , very traffic location to reach hotel when it’s traffic peak! Compare other hotel that’s all!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Trip.com Member,4.1,Very good. Highly recommended. Friendly staff. There is a subway nearby. Breakfast is ok. The scenery is nice. The whole experience is cost-effective. The price is very favorable. Highly recommended. You can give it a try. It’s nice to stay.
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,safia hares,5.0,"Lana, was very helpful and understanding. The cafe has been just what I needed after very long flight to relax and have some amazing drinks and food. Best customer service. Highly recommend. Staff are always happy to help you. Will be coming back again."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Bobby William,5.0,"Almost everything about this hotel is great. Room is very spacious, the bathroom is clean and shower pressure is great. The Gym is probably one of the best hotel gym for this budget. It has a squat rack with barbell and bumper plates, heavy dumbbell options, multiple treadmills and calisthenic bar for dips. There are some things that could be improved like, the wifi signal (i stayed at the 28th floor) could’ve been better, breakfast was bland and the chicken is really dry. Egg cooking station waiting time is really long. But other than that i still give this place a full 5 stars rating because of the gym. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Alfathania Syakura,5.0,"The room was amazing!!! We got an executive suite and the view was great! I had such a good night sleep there! We had breakfast in the hotel too! Mira was so nice! The milk was empty so I asked her if she can refill the milk and she personally send a glass of milk to my table. Besides, she could speak english so it’s easier for us to communicate what we want. Altho food quality still need a lot of improvement, I still enjoyed my breakfast here because of the service :)"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Anggito Arifin,5.0,"What an unexpected and enjoyable breakfast experience. I underestimated the taste of each dish but yeaa I was wrong, it was delicious. One of my fav dishes is chicken noodles. It has a good chili sauce. Special thanks goes to Mba Mira. I greatly appreciate your help💯

This is the view outside. I hope this makes your day🥰"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Yanee W,5.0,"Enjoyed our 2 nights at the Executive Suite. Room is very spacious, clean and adequate. I love how the room has full length mirror everywhere.
Breakfast spread is only ok. Food quality needs improvement. Service is good, no complaint. Thank you to Mira for taking care of us during breakfast."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Gio Aguste,5.0,"I had a wonderful stay at Kemang Icon Jakarta. The suite I stayed in called Ionic suite, it was not only spacious but also uniquely decorated with a classic touch, giving it a charming ambiance.

The staff, while not numerous, were incredibly friendly and attentive. They made sure I had a comfortable and enjoyable experience throughout my stay.

While the breakfast was served à la carte rather than buffet-style, the food was absolutely delicious and satisfying.

Overall, Kemang Icon Jakarta impressed me with its spacious and charming suite, attentive staff, and delectable breakfast. It's definitely a hotel that maintains a high level of performance. Please keep the performance."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Andrew B,4.0,"First comment: Be cautious lately about any reviews of Jakarta Hotels. From my feeling most of them are fake and asked for by the reception staff. It is easy to spot as most write exactly the same content. ||The hotel is located more to the South of Jakarta. ||Check in at the hotel was pleasant and hassle free. ||The only issue was that the pictures on the forums looked different to the room I got. ||The hotel staff was very helpful to accommodate me. After viewing other rooms I stayed at that initial room. ||While it might not be the real 5* hotel, however, housekeeping is very prompt and any issues are addressed very expeditiously also. ||If you take the option with breakfast, it is just a Western or Indonesian option, but not buffet style but food is sufficient for breakfast. ||During my stay pool was closed for a function on one day as the hotel roof seems to be a favourite spot for parties, but actually, the pool is quite small, so not of any much distraction anyway. ||The place has a bar at the roof also, alcoholic drinks are at just 7.50 USD (affordable). ||Cons: |- TV screen is quite small compared to the room space. also cannot be watched at the seating area. |- Bathroom has an totally open concept|- Certain housekeeping items have to be ordered by phone|- Not all Towels are on 5* level| - Water kettle should be replaced by non plastic type|- Front rooms nearer to the main street may be noisier from traffic and bars||Pros: |- Room design is different in every room and packed with arts and accessoires |- Rooms are spacious |- Bed was comfy fitted with one thinner and one harder pillow|- Room make up is excellent and place really cleaned up. |- Wifi worked for me, each rooms have an own wifi spot|- The room has some sound speakers to listen to music or for tv|- Rooms are fitted with two aircons, which you can control temperate just like at home. ||You don't get the branded 5* night rates but still the rooms and service level are on an upper level. ||While people complained in earlier reviews that there is only one lift, but the hotel just has about 20 rooms on 2 floors, so for me it wasn't an issue. ||I would though recommend the hotel to close the bathroom with some nice wooden wall and just leave a small part open. ||Nearby the hotel are many fancy restaurants and bars, one shopping mall (Lippo Mall) is around 800m away (with a Hypermarket).  Pagi Sore (Nasi Padang) and Sawaregmoe Resto (inside at Kemang 10 ""mall"")  has good Indonesian fare. There are many fancy coffee places for coffee lovers... and many more restaurants from $ to $$$ also in the area.||Overall, on a working trip, I had a pleasant enjoyable stay at the hotel. But note that the area is much in the South of Jakarta, so for first time tourists or Jakarta sightseeing interests the Kemang Icon might not be the most suitable location.  If you need huge shopping malls with fancy brand stores around you, then it wouldn't be suitable also. |"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Agus Suci Wulandari,5.0,"Love this Hotel, located in a very strategic un Kemang, you can find a lot of places for eat, leisure, and coffee (of course!)
The room is spacious enough, elegant interior,  instagramable roof top, staff are friendly. Rate of this hotel is affordable for a 4 star hotel, overall a nice experience when staying in this hotel."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Firza Destrian,5.0,"What a lovely boutique hotel in Kemang area.
Nice aesthetically decorated building with artistic touch of each suites.
Fabulous service particularly Mas Erick. Will come back soon"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Stay40701668883,4.0,"Was here with 6 colleagues, was fine. Felt like it must have been amazing 20 years ago.  A bit older now, especially the rooms. There are a total of 12 rooms, so if there is anything you don’t like just ask to change (some rooms have open showers).  Rooms were nice though.  Breakfast was fine, blu cheese burger for dinner was amazing.  We had meetings in south Jakarta so it was convenient for us.  There are a lot of restaurants nearby, which is nice. Enjoyed breakfast outside on the rooftop in the mornings."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,angela d,5.0,"Very nice hotel, fabulous decor. Helpful staff, great views from the rooftop. We spent 3 nights here, we would come back. The room we stayed in was huge, it had an office and a fridge freezer! Everything was clean and comfy. We had everything we needed."

Kemang Icon Jakarta,Bishop Force,5.0,Nice an cozy place to stay...tranquil and love the ambience...
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Abbott Hsu,5.0,"A very well organized and delicate hotel in Kemang area. You can feel how the owner wants to create the modern and traditional atmosphere by having mixed decoration inside.
The staff are really friendly to serve you no matter in room service or at it's bistro. Though there are 12 rooms here, the overall maintenance and service are super good. A good place to stay on weekends or holidays at Kemang. Enjoy it."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Hendy Hendrawan M,5.0,"Nice, unique place... Perfect for family staycation."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Kris Trimoeljo,3.0,"I booked this hotel tempted by the photos, room size and price.
While the room is big , I think the maintenance has not been paid good attention. You can take a look at the pictures.
With abundance of choice at around similar price level, I may not return back here"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Abah Ibik,5.0,"Best Roof top Restaurant.and..Very aesthetic Small hotel...

Kemang Icon Jakarta,Lestari Astriani,5.0,"Unique place, nice room ambience, good food, very recomended"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Gee H,4.0,"It's been some time that I visited this establishment.||What used to me Alila run and owned, has been now become locally run and owned.||Prior to check in, the staff said: we are now independent, kindly forgive us in advance to any shortage of delivery that you may experience.||Now, that statement makes me wonder or worry how bad can they be now that is independently owned. But thankfully, it was not all that bad but, there are areas which can be improved.||The main road is right now underway of expansion so there are works going on, in Agoda, it was not indicated so honesty should be kept because I would still have stayed at the premise regardless.||The location is at the T junction of Kemang Raya. Brace yourself for insane traffic during nights, it's a busy area so do take note. But it's littered with trendy cafes and eateries in the vicinity.||Rooms - what I had was the Ivory. But as there are only 12 rooms in the whole establishment, it'll be nice that we can get to see the rooms as it is not labelled as: courtyard suites generically. There were so many images that indicated Courtyard Suites and some of the images showed a bigger and better room which I thought I paid for. ||Clean and big room made me happy but the size of the TV was sorry to say, A JOKE. Granted that a guest here should not focus on watching the TV rather than enjoying the facilities and also location environment but to provide a HUGE room with a 24"" TV was just ridiculous!||The design of the room plugs were also odd with all power plugs being used for lights the such. Ironic how I had to use a light dedicated plug for the kettle because the coffee area had NO plugs.||The room was encased in external glass but as it's literally a handshake away from the next building, security can be compromised. How about adding another layer of dead glass to current glass layer that can be opened? Apply 2 way glass treatment on that for privacy. Also, this will reduce noise pollution from neighborhood and also the main Street.||Room amenities were quite bare. Yes there were water and coffee facilities but the shower gel were not topped up. The towels were cream looking ( not that it's that colour but white has turned into pale and tired cream!) The room slippers were similar of that in POP hotel. ||In a nutshell - where is the opulance?! It's a boutique hotel. The room was nothing but not. Slapping a nice rug and white everything hardly justifies it as such.||Decor - it was quite interesting but many spaces were oddly left alone to its own devices. It's like a white elephant. What a waste of perfectly fine space! It could be made more interesting - this I leave to the management employees.||Food - the rooftop was beautiful. At night it was great. And in the day, it's inviting. So we had dinner and bfast there and I have no complaints on the quality and standards of food. ||Staff - all friendly and helpful, I have no complaints as well.||Overall, it's sad to see an icon as such being undertaken locally but not allowed to fully show it's potential. ||My comments, I feel, should they be met, will surely put Icon up to its previous glory again. 4/5 stars due to my comments above but otherwise, it could have been a 5star experience from me. ||"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Mohd Nafzahizam Mohd Adnan,5.0,My 2nd time here. Love the room and the services. All staffs were really helpful. Great location as well!
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Josh Patil,1.0,"The worst hotel I’ve ever been too. Staff don’t care at all to help. Empty promises. Woke up to my room completely flooded in water the first morning. WiFi hasn’t worked for 2 days. Construction FROM the hotel starts at 7am and drills into the rooms from outside.

They have ZERO thought of customer service. A 1 star hotel under the disguise of a 4.

What a rip off."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Santino Pasini,1.0,"Kemang Icon by Alila was one of our favourite hotels and I have stayed here many times years ago. Today is my first visit here again after maybe 4 or 5 years. I was very excited for the great experience again. Then, we are shocked to see what we see today.

First of all, the furniture and the fixtures inside the room are not in good condition anymore. We can understand that for a hotel that is more than 10 years old. But what really upsets us is the broken elevator on our second day which has forced us to walk up the stairs to our room on the 3rd floor. I can handle this ‘exercise’ but we have our 75 years old mother with us and it is very hard for her to do that. What frustrating is the problem cannot be fixed promptly by the hotel. And there is no duty manager available on the premises!

Unfortunately the bad experience does not stop there. When we had our dinner at the edge restaurant, our tenderloin steak and rib eye steak were very dry and hard. It was far from juicy and soft meat that I remember when I ate here years ago. This time it really taste like a frozen meat that has been kept for days and not cooked properly at all.

I am very disappointed because I really liked this hotel before. Apparently, the hotel is not part of Alila anymore. Is this the reason of such a downgrade in quality? Current management of the hotel MUST do things right urgently if they still want to exist"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,chrissy djafar,5.0,"Back to this place for the African food, the best !"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Erika HDRF,5.0,The vibe and the view was just perfect. We caught the sun as it was setting and the night lights were stunning. We got the advantage of using the upper room and the decor was wow. Great spots for a photo shoot. Oh and i suggest this place for private parties. Great place
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Omri Ben-Canaan,5.0,"Kemang Icon is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in in Jakarta.
Rooms are huge: 85sqm - Staff is super friendly and helpful and location is ideal, very central.
Restaurant is delicious with a lot of different cuisines so no need to venture outside or gojek anything.
There is a beautiful pool on the rooftop too.
Will definitely come back.
5 stars hands down."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,deetje d,5.0,"Myself and my husband celebrated Valentines Day and stayed at the hotel.The rooms are very large and all unique in interior design and decoration. We were made very welcome by all the staff but looked superbly by the General Manager, Mr Stanley.  ||We had a lovely Valentine Dinner in the evening and a good range of food was available for breakfast.||Would fully recommend this hotel and hope to be back soon."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Remko Simons,4.0,"Small hotel (only 12 rooms), large hotel rooms, a little bit old but still have nice design. Bathroom open space without door"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Dewi Wulandari,5.0,"I always have a special room in my heart for small hotels like this one. It only has 12 rooms BUT each room was uniquely designed, so each one is different. I stayed at illusion room, which was very spacious. It needs a bit of TLC on the interior but I heard it is scheduled for renovation. Mas Ilham the manager was very helpfull. Breakfast, wasn't buffet but you get to order from a list  that is all looked very delicious. I stayed here alone to get some me time and it's worth every dime. I got the sense of space and quietness that I dearly needed. And I already scheduled to come again on new year with my family. Conclusion? You should definitely put this hotel in your list"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Saiful Bakri,5.0,Hotel is a bit run down. Still quite charming. Location is decent.
Kemang Icon Jakarta,efrikson nadeak,5.0,"Always Best experience To visit this hotel and  Restaurant,  I always  Happy, comfort And enjoy In here, recommended To try this hotep and restaurant"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,muhamad A,5.0,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel, the rooms are nice and luxurious but classic impression, the employees are all good, when we checked in everything was informed to us by a staff named Nixon he is a good person and very friendly, for breakfast we were served well and the food was delicious if I'm not mistaken his name is chef Rudy and what amazed me he asked How did the food taste and I said it was delicious, we also had time to talk with chef Fahmy he served us very well, thank you for all the good service and food Super delicious ..., thank you to all the staff who served us, keep it up, keep up the good work Kemang icon"
Sutasoma Hotel,Lim CY,4.0,"Varies choice of local cuisine in the breakfast buffet. Coffee table arrays are sofas mostly. However if you prefer proper table and chairs to dine in, the choice is there as well.

Ms Linda had great personality and we talked about surroundings nearby the hotel. Mr Welly make great coffee to my preference."
Sutasoma Hotel,Philina Lauw,5.0,"I totally enjoyed my stay here because all the staff were so helpful. They even allowed me to have early check in because I have no where else to go. What I love most was the serenity, the peaceful environmeng. Such a great hotel."
Sutasoma Hotel,Mary Anne Luis,5.0,"Hotel staff are very friendly, attentive, and always ready to help; hotel rooms are very clean, and facilities are in excellent condition; food is also good. Many many thanks to Nadia and the GM for aways going the extra mile and making my stay quite memorable! Will definitely recommend this hotel to others."
Sutasoma Hotel,James Smith,5.0,"Five (5) stars are not enough for me to rate this hotel as the comfort and service provided far surpassed my expectations and  went far beyond any previous hotel stays I have experienced, and I have travelled internationally quite a lot over the past 25 years.  I came here on a two-week business trip and I decided I didn't want to stay at one of the chain hotels but rather I wanted to stay at a boutique hotel that had more of a local flavour.  I decided on the Sutasoma hotel due to the excellent reviews and its proximity to the places I needed to go.  I decided to book only for a few days at the Sutasoma Hotel and then would decide whether or not I would stay longer.  After experiencing excellent comfort and outstanding service, how could I possibly leave?  So I stayed for the entire 2 weeks which turned into 3 weeks as there were delays in the project I was working on.  During my stay, each and every one of the staff went well out of their way to accommodate this ""bule.""  While everyone was so friendly and helpful in every respect, there are a few people that really stood out and went the extra mile to accommodate me namely:  Linda, Lexi, Basri & Welly (I may have spelled one or more of these names wrong).  I had mentioned earlier during my stay that my Singaporian friend back in New York insisted that I bring back a Lappis Legit cake.  On my final day, Linda surprised me with a beautifully wrapped large Lappis Legit cake.  I was overcome with emotion and gratitude that Linda would go well out of her way for this bule.  Lexi, Linda and Bisra and others were so respectful to my driver and make him feel so welcome.  I must also mention how comfortable my room was, each and every day and while all the cleaners were very, very good, I must make special mention of Badri.  Each day, after a long work-day, it was so nice to come ""home"" to a freshly made bed, turned down with my slippers alongside the bed.  Usually a nice pasty was next to my bed and on some days fresh fruit delivered to my room.  Fresh towels were always provided, bathroom items replenished, plenty of water provided as well as the packets of coffee, tea and condiments.  I am writing this on my final day, only to learn a couple of hours ago that my flight has been rescheduled to the following day.  I am looking on the bright side; I get to stay another day in my ""home away from home with my new friends."""
Sutasoma Hotel,Inaya Y,5.0,"Came back here to stay for 3 days and 2 nights in room #520. Stayed during the Chinese New Year long weekend 👍🏻 (9-11th of Feb). We came back because I was craving the Mashed Potatoes we like so much and the scent of the Hotel ✨🫶🏻 turned out my very first breakfast on the 10th of Feb has no Mashed Potatoes menu in it lol 😄 We decided to ask the Atman Lounge staff which they explained that the everyday breakfast menu has changes with everyday rotation, Mashed Potatoes were served on Tuesday/Wednesday. We were sad but Atman Lounge breakfast has never failed us (with or without the mashed potatoes😆) we were approached by one of the staff Mba Linda and she asked how was the breakfast and we told her that we miss your mashed potatoes and she said she will look out for the next upcoming mashed potatoes menu that will be served during breakfast. ||During our second breakfast on the 11th of Feb, surprisingly the breakfast menu has Mashed Potatoes served Alhamdulilah. We were so happy and shocked we thought it’ll be serve on Tuesday/Wednesday 😄😄 (this was on Sunday) Mba Linda came to approached us and told that she managed to tell the chef to serve the menu with Mashed Potatoes. Thank you so much we were so grateful for the services and hospitality. Highly respect Mba Linda and the Chef for doing it for us 🤍🤍🤍 ||While checking out, Mas Welly helped us taking some pictures in the Lounge. Mas Welly and Mba Linda gave us another compliment with a free Chocolate Mousse for me snacking 🥰 thankiyu so muchhhh. Me and my Husband will definitely be back soon, just very soon🥰🫶🏻👍🏻👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Sutasoma has the best services and hospitality no doubt 🤟🏻✨👌🏻"

Sutasoma Hotel,Yasmin Inaya,5.0,"Stayed here for 1 night in room #522 on 13th-14th of January. It was an unforgettable experience for me & my husband! My cousin had her wedding night next to this Hotel in Tribrata (a walking distance from the Hotel) which made me booked this Hotel. The room is not too spacious however it was VERY CLEAN and smells so good. We received a baby-moon complimentary services which have made me and my husband so happy 🥰🫶🏻✨the front desk staff was very helpful as well as the bellboy (Mas Rossi) The food was our favorite thing! Had some of Tribrata’s food during the wedding night and the next morning, we had breakfast at the Atman Lounge and surprisingly the food quality was superb and SUPER DELICIOUS. We had a lot of options 👍🏻👍🏻 stayed for 2 hours just for our breakfast, MasyaAllah. Thank you for the Front Office & Housekeeping team that has decorated our room beautifully. We are very sure we’re going to be back before our baby labour.

PS;
We’re in love with Kue Lapis evening snacks and Keripik Nangka 😍😍😍
And the Mashed Potatoes on breakfast was AMAZING ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ would love to be back just to have breakfast again at Atman Lounge."
Sutasoma Hotel,Diana Pratama,5.0,"Had a pleasant stay here ❤️

Stay at Kakawin Suite for 3D2N so spacious and comfortable. The bed, sofa, bathroom are clean, all staff are helpful and nice. Breakfast at Atman Lounge i really enjoy because i love indonesian food and traditional cake available there. I love strolling around here, the view with aesthetic classic architecture. And for dinner at elisse was amazing food and mocktails too 😘👌🏻

Absolutely will come back here very soon ❤️🥰"
Sutasoma Hotel,Shaina Gandanegara,5.0,"I had a delightful stay at Sutasoma Hotel. The place is exceptionally beautiful, and the staff members were incredibly accommodating. While the hotel might not be as expansive as it appears from the front, it still provided an enjoyable experience. The spacious beds and perfectly sized rooms made for a comfortable and cozy stay. I would definitely recommend it!

One added perk was the hotel's proximity to numerous Korean cuisine options, making dining choices both convenient and enjoyable during my stay."
Sutasoma Hotel,Diah Ika,5.0,"Don’t hesitate to book this hotel it’s really the paradise with people always want you to feel home like Rico, Linda, Fuzan, Sofia and a perfect cuisine with a changing menu everyday made by a kind Chef. Would recommend 10000%"
Sutasoma Hotel,Bima Rantautama,5.0,"Hotel is near with city center. It's very close with MRT access so its quite easy to ger arround. Room is perfect, food is yummy and service is marvelous.

Thanks for Ms. Willa for arranging wonderful weekend for me and family."
Sutasoma Hotel,Cahyadi P,5.0,Had my first meeting experience at Gala Rooftop at Sutasoma. The room is spacious with interesting concept of separate coffee break and lunch buffet area. So that participants move and walk around to get the food and beverage. It is good to refresh after sitting for a while. There is also an open space (outdoor) which will be great for barbeque or outdoor activities. The server is consistently friendly and helpful : Ari. Thank you so much
Sutasoma Hotel,Kanitta Tongdaeng,5.0,This's my first time to visit this country such a good memory I got by this hotel crews. Thank you Linda for your smile every morning when I went to have breakfast and hope to see you in Bangkok!!!

Sutasoma Hotel,Savitri Indraswari,5.0,"Stayed 2 night here and had a wonderful experience. Great hotel, great staffs and great breakfast !
Would recommend this hotel to anyone who need to stay in the south. Would definitely come back next time :)"
Sutasoma Hotel,Isabella A,5.0,"The room is spacious and comfy. All the staff are always helpful and friendly, the room service is just a one call away and will come immediately. There are various complimentary snacks and refillable mineral water. The provided amenities are sterile and useful. I really enjoyed the stay in here!"
Sutasoma Hotel,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Facilities: The swimming pool is super comfortable and cleanService: Very friendlyEnvironment: Very high-end, very quiet, suitable for business families, etc.Health: very goodIt's a very nice hotel. I will go there again next time.Breakfast is rich"
Sutasoma Hotel,Renz Calub,5.0,Sutasoma Hotel has been our first home when we made our big move to Jakarta from the Philippines. We enjoyed our stay. The rooms are nice and spacious. The breakfast buffet is good and unforgettable because of the Indomie station! We hope to return to Sutasoma for a staycation or brunch soon!
Sutasoma Hotel,Trip.com Member,3.5,"Nice design and basic room. Nothing much around the vicinity of the hotel even though it is in Dharmawangsa . . unfortunately the wrong side!So if you are looking for cafes, bars, eateries around the hotel better not stay here. This hotel is attached to a convention hall which I believe is popular for weddings. So could be crowded and noisy if there is a wedding or event going on. Breakfast was pretty good and affordable. Service overall is very good . . all the staff try to make the guests happy.The cafe food is ok if you stick to the standard Indonesian cuisine. We tried the Tom Yam Goong Soup and it was totally not right! But in all fairness the F&B manager did not charge us for it after we gave him the feedback.Will probably stay again if we have meetings that way."
Sutasoma Hotel,Johanes S,4.0,"Service was good, hotel staffs are very friendly. Food is excellent for its price point. Well-maintained and hoping it would stay that way. ||Would give this hotel a full mark if they improve their poor soundproofing, would not recommend this hotel for light sleepers like myself as you’ll be woken up by noises from your neighbors, even a normal conversation could be heard."
Sutasoma Hotel,Mile R,3.0,"The hotel is conveniently located to the mall where restaurants, super market and drug store are there.
It’s a pity because……..:
The bathroom lacks Towel Rack, Hooks, Drawers.
When we entered, toilet seat was dirty, the washbasin water didn’t run smoothly.
Towels were greyish looking.
There was cockroache in the bathroom.
At the coffee shop, the rice was hard, it looked like the cheff was using old rice to make fright rice.
Room temperature was freezing, we couldn’t adjust it to lower."
Sutasoma Hotel,Padmasita Kumoro,5.0,Breakfast was great. Mba Linda - Mas Welly from Atman were very friendly and helpful. Thank you.
Sutasoma Hotel,Charmaine Yong,4.0,"Convenient location with cafes and restaurants nearby (skewed towards Korean and Japanese restaurants). Bed is very comfy and the room is very clean, the only issue was waiting for the iron and ironing board that took an hour to be sent to my room.  Had to call the reception 3 times but other than that, a very pleasant stay."
Sutasoma Hotel,Jarupath Jitdoungprem (LordGift),5.0,"Very nice place and good service.

Breakfast lounge has many foods for foreigner. They can try Indonesian food or choose  their familiar.

Central heating may have some problem because it too slow to warm water.

The wall may be too thin because I can hear voices from  another room."
Sutasoma Hotel,Vidi,5.0,"Amazing stay, very unexpected! Every decoration and details (like the air freshener) was so pretty and traditionally elegant. Everything that's metal are gold-colored, adding to the elegant ambience. Great AC, in-room dining and room layout. Exceptional receptionists who keep on helping me for stuffs like printing my boarding pass and other small errands. The only minus were the shower that sounds a lot sometimes when it's not being used, and the other guests. Was unfortunate enough to be in the same floor as so many kids and family traveler who were very loud, ringing the doorbell a lot of time, and running around the corridor the whole time. Even ringing on my doorbell once as a mistake. But otherwise a great hotel!"
Sutasoma Hotel,Kk Dede,5.0,"Amazing servicee! We had breakfast on our weekday, and greets by Mba Linda, and Mas Bisri, they offered us an omelette and a cup of coffee/tea, and they are very kindfull of act of service. Thank you so much"
Sutasoma Hotel,Jsnsmbw,5.0,"I was coming for having breakfast at Atman Lounge, and surprisingly they could accept outsider guest to enjoy the breakfast as well. A very warm welcome from the front desk Mas Adi, and he escorted me to restaurant and showing the room. During breakfast i was assisted by Mas Bisri and he was very kind and helpful.||||At the moment Mas Adi came to my table and ask for further assistance, then i asked for room showing if possible and he assist me accordingly with informative detail explained.||I was thrilled by his exceptional hospitality. Thank you!"
Sutasoma Hotel,Mei Mei,4.0,"Nice hotel, smells really good. Room is clean and neat. Located in quiet street, very close to 2 korean supermarkets.

The room is not big but comfortable enough, with long seat by the window."
Goodrich Suites,Che Sheila,5.0,"I had an amazing stay here. My room was the Royal Suite, which had a bathtub with city view. They set up a crib for my baby so we could all sleep comfortably. The breakfast choices were great too. There were lots to choose from, and all of them were high-quality dishes, well presented and well prepared. However, their Nasi Uduk was to die for. That one item was the most memorable to me, compared to the other items in the buffet. Their Nasi Uduk was fragrant and well seasoned. The rich coconut aroma and spices really lingered in my mouth. It was very appetizing and left a pleasant aftertaste. It was so good on its own, but the side dishes are what made the meal complete. The staff was friendly and helpful. The interior of the whole hotel was luxurious but not overwhelming.

I will surely recommend this hotel."
Goodrich Suites,anastasia ratrih,4.0,"+ room is quite big, comfy, clean, smells sooo good💙
+ the hotel staffs are really nice & helpful
+ bathroom was great & clean
+ got upgraded room hehehe

- I got the towel at 5pm bcs of their vendor late to send them and the towel was smelly
- the water heater not really ""heat""
- aircon not really cold at the maximum
- breakfast was delicious, but less variety of foods
- no kids playground facility

4/5. will be back for sureee! worth it!"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,3.5,"When im check in the room is clean however i found House lizard dead in the room, tha hot water in the bathtub is not working also but the staff was quick for taking action. The room is quite noisy since the room is facing to front side."
Goodrich Suites,Vincent T,2.0,"Bad wifi signal, I had to use mobile data as it doesn't even reach the bed. A 3 rating hotel at best while somehow having a 5 star rating. While the hotel has decent rooms and exudes an air of luxury, it lacks the refinement that usually begins at 4 star hotels, mediocre food, poor use of digital media, lack of care for small details and the rooms do not accommodate for foreign travelers. There are often parties on Friday night in this area, so expect a bit of noise from outside and a lot of noise downstairs."
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,3.7,"There are cockroaches in the bathroom. But I like the service, my special request was fulfilled. It's just that things like food ordered outside have to be picked up in the basement, you can't ask for it to be brought."
Goodrich Suites,Aldila Ayuningtyas,5.0,"Some company held Iftar party but me and my son still allowed to go swimming in the pool, staff are friendly. We had really good experience, room also spacious"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,5.0,"A very satisfying experience. The hotel is clean, the service is attentive, the space is huge, and the feeling of the suite is truly unparalleled and exceeded expectations. The hotel was arranged on the side not facing the street, so it was protected from the roaring motorcycles in Jakarta. In the middle of the night, I discovered that there was a night light hanging on the closet that couldn't be turned off. I called customer service, and they took a ladder and a vise and snapped the wires off. The efficiency in solving the problem is worthy of praise. I'm more curious about how foreigners sleep with this lamp on. A very good hotel, clean and spacious. I will stay here again next time."
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,4.5,"Location:Everywhere in Jakarta is busy hence no matter the location it would be busy. From where the hotel is, with jam, its 1 hour to the airport. Cleanliness:The hotel is extremely clean. The bathroom is huge and luxurious. The bed and pillows are comfortable. The room size spacious and everything works well!Staff:There wasn’t much conversation nor request from us as we are easy travellers. But the receptionist was polite and kind during our check in/out. Not much issue."
Goodrich Suites,Andromeda Hayu Kurniawan,5.0,"Cozy place, strategic place, but somehow maybe at restourat at 3 floor need more fast time for serving food cause last time we order some food it's need atleast 45 minute for serving foods and drinks"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,4.5,"Good Rich Suites offers exceptional value for your money.

Goodrich Suites,Tania Federica,1.0,Mba marketing eventnya ga niat ladenin tamu & ga professional. Untung all team resto very helpful & ramah. Will not recommend this to all people who wanna arrange event here if she was still the marketing of this hotel.

Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,5.0,The hotel is very comfortable. The location is very good. It is close to the subway station. I am on a business trip. The staff at the front desk are also friendly. The room is clean and hygienic. It is very convenient to order food 24 hours a day.
Goodrich Suites,Neysa Nurannisa,5.0,"A really good experience at Goodrich. Spacious room, express checkin process, a reallyreally good breakfast with lots of choice."
Goodrich Suites,tsakila dania,4.0,"Cheapest and the most best value for money for 5 star hotel in jakarta! Breakfast was AMAZING and cheap. I would recommend this place! Amazing and unique interior design! Huge room with a bathtub! You have to notice something tho, there are a lot of illegal racing at night ( can be loud ), Small pool, a lot of dirty small details or scratched. And a pretty much small hotel for a 5 star. Staff was friendly and amazing tho! Well there are some minus and plus but I personally can tolerate the minus. But I would say its a 4 star hotel instead of 5. I would still recommend it because of the price, bath tub and breakfast!"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The room was good, clean and the place very strategic.We give 3 star for the facilities since the AC very hot until the engineer fixed it. The wifi also needed to fix, to make it more faster network, and very sorry since they dont provide the refrigerator (only coolbar)."
Goodrich Suites,Jojo S,3.0,"I am honestly disappointed with the service from workers at a 5 star class hotel in an elite area, namely in Kemang. Before I entered the hotel, I registered via WhatsApp asking for a baby bed for my toddler. Even when I arrived at the hotel, I reminded him again. I even called 2 or 3 times to ask why it hasn't been delivered yet. I even brought my stuff to my room myself because there was only one tool to carry customer's stuff to their room. Seriously for a 5 star hotel?? For the room and bathroom I was quite satisfied because it was big and quite clean. Then for breakfast, I eat at 09.45 in the morning which is they close at 10.30 but some of the food is empty and cold and then not refilled. In any hotel I stay, it's not even a 5-star hotel, even if the food runs out and closing time is still quite far, it's always refilled. Quite shocked. Then for the taste of the food apart from dessert, honestly quite disappointed again. Even on the table there is no tissue. My child accidentally spilled the infusion water then under the baby's chair was full of water and I asked some woman to clean it along with saying sorry for the trouble. The woman who guards the coffee machine idk the name with an unfriendly face just looks at it and nods her head. A man came long enough just to clean the floor. And indeed this woman is quite unfriendly to customers, yes, because there is no greeting whatsoever because when I entered the breakfast room I felt wow, it was really bad, there was no one guarding the front to ask what room it was from. Come in, just come in😅 even the workers there, if they run into a customer, don't say hello, just pass by. My suggestion it would be better if the workers were retrained for the sake of the continuity of this hotel itself, because my husband (a foreigner) gave an opinion that this hotel actually had to improve for many things because he had never found a 5 star hotel with service and breakfast  like this. Parking area is also very limited. Sorry but this is an honest review from me."
Goodrich Suites,Adi P,5.0,"I had a staycation with my wife and she was amazed by the interior and nuance of the room. The bed and the pillow was comfortable. Moreover, since my wife loves jacuzzi and there is a bathtub in the bathroom, it makes our staycation more complete.||Additionally, huge credits to the resto. The foods were nice and they served me well. Thanks to (sorry for mistyping) Mr. Faldy, Mr. Alfath, Mr. Azril and Mr Lutfi for welcoming and serving us friendly.||Once again, thanks for the hospitality and you did a good job Goodrich…"
Goodrich Suites,Prihadi Ramadhany,5.0,"3rd time stayed in this hotel, they have different room layout, my favorite room layout is room with number ending with 16 (e.g. 516, 416, etc.).  Toilet seat is heated and has many function buttons.

Location is at south Jakarta, where Kemang, Simatupang, Cipete, Fatmawati is nearby.

Its nice & quite hotel, except for Friday where its a

little bit crowded in parking area because people

coming for their restaurant & cafe on 8th floor. Room service f&b is good, tried gado-gado, oxtail soup and soto betawi.

Bfast selections its similar to most hotels, bread, pastry, fresh juice and western/indonesian food selections.

Checkin g checkout process is fast.

Will back for sure"
Goodrich Suites,Zaxman,4.0,Stay for one nite during Ramadan. The room was big enough but I wouldn't called it a suite. We didn't use the facility so I can't comment about it. Food during suhoor was the low point as the choice was less than adequate. Taste was so so but I give big point for the room.
Goodrich Suites,tika t,5.0,"Room is clean, spacious. The room vibe is comfortable. We bought room package with breakfast, the staffs were accommodating. Mas Sandi from the restaurant was very friendly, making sure we get good service. Good hospitality overall."
Goodrich Suites,Pavan KAPOOR,5.0,We attended a church event here last week and the function room was very a very good size for our group. The ambience of the hotel lobby is amazing too.
Goodrich Suites,Jeffry J,1.0,I have stayed here multiple times and this time i have a very bad experience. Lack of coordination between reception and breakfast room. I got tricked multiple times by the reception name Dela. So embarased and will never return to this hotel again
Goodrich Suites,cut emyra,4.0,"The hotel location very good near Kemang and near main road so easily accessible. The room also big and bath tub also available in certain type of room. Also available bar at the rooftop so you can easily hang out without go outside.

But, the services (in the restaurant) quite dissapointed and they need more train their waiter."
Goodrich Suites,Nugroho Ajie B,5.0,"Goodrich hotel is excellent. Located in the south area of Jakarta, near the Kemang, Cipete, Antasari, Blok M area.||The room is spacious and well furnished. Served on a cozy resto on the 3rd floor, the breakfast were tasty. The service was excellent, especially Mr. Fadil"
Goodrich Suites,Claire Bohrer,1.0,"Avoid at all costs! Never have I ever had such a miserable experience at a hotel (side note, this hotel is 3 star at best; the 5 star description is laughable).

Firstly, each night the hotel hosts events on the third and eight floor. Events with DJs and loud base and these hotel rooms are not sound proof. It doesn’t matter which floor you are on, the noise will carry and you will not get sleep until the event ends. Other issues include ratty towels with stains and bathrobes with holes large enough for your leg to fit through. The front desk attendants are also inattentive and won’t even give your room a call when you have a delivery. I cannot find a single nice thing to say."
Goodrich Suites,Adhika Mafran,4.0,"Affordable price for 5 star hotel.

Rooms :
Roadway noise, you can hear car's horn in the middle of the night. Like the room doesn't have soundproof.
The room has a sofa window and you can see others windows from here.

Buffet : Limited choice
Staff : Pleasant staff."
Goodrich Suites,Barried Gharizah,1.0,"Stayed in the Royal Suites Room. Room was decent however the layout was totally different from the advertised pictures. We booked the room because we wanted to enjoy the bath tub by the window but we didn’t get that. Understand that the availability is limited, but still disappointed. This wasn’t what we booked for.
Another issue was with the water. It was yellow/brown! Definitely don’t want to soak my body in that water. Complained and the staff just told us to keep draining the water until it is clear. We never had experienced this in any other hotel! They should clean their water tank/pipes!!
The room was also not soundproof. During the night, we kept hearing the music from the club downstairs and even from the nearby neighborhood event in the morning.
They offered compensation (free breakfast) but still it wasn’t an enjoyable stay."
