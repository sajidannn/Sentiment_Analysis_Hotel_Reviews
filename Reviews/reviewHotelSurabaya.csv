Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Caroline A,5.0,"This hotel is amazing. Great rooms and helpful staff. Check in check out process was also quite fast. Stayed in this hotel for 1 night. Loving everything the minute I stepped into the lobby of this hotel. The infinity pool area is spectacular especially the view and its jacuzzi area. Also, Mr.UNGGUL as the Pool Staff really blew me away with his attentiveness and willingness to help. Deserving of its 5 star rating."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,saint_p3g4zus,5.0,"Excellent service, friendly staffs, especially at pool with Pak Unggul as pool attendant. Restaurant staffs also similar services for all staffs but not have a chance to see all names. The food also good for 5 stars hotel. The only things to be changed is theme for rooms which ‚Äúscary‚Äù enough for kids|Need some change and refreshment for rooms theme"

Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Eric Effin' P - MTB Content,4.0,"Visited Feb '23

Staff - great. Polite and helpful.

Premise - quite well maintained. Very lush feel. Beside a mall. Pool is a tad too small. View was nice. Near to a mosque so expect prayer sound on the constant.

Room - big and nice. Smells good for smoking room. Odd was the light switches. Almost couldn't find the room lights but did not manage to find the toilet light switches. AC didn't work when arrived but was taken care thereafter. Apologies came in the form of fruit platters daily.

Overall, is a good place to stay. Not so much for staycation however due to small pool size. All else was good for a getaway if need be. Priced fair for the quality of hotel, can consider this hotel should you want a less crowded area."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,shali72,5.0,Sella has very good personality and gives me great comfort on staying this hotel. From check in till staying plus a wonderful breakfast spread. Well done for all staff here. Will definitely come back again.

Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,evan dewabrata,4.0,"The Staff is very helpfull and friendly. Always offer you help anytime you need with a big smile.

point to improve: will be much much better if the request to give review on the google, can be done after the guests are having their breakfast.. not in the middle of it."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,nureko l,5.0,"When I stayed here it was very comfortable, especially in the Wellness area, namely in the Gym and Swimming pool, there was Mr. Unggul Staff who was very helpful and friendly... Thank you Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Dini Kusumawardhani,5.0,"the room I was checked in has standard size, but the ceiling is high so it is fine and feels big. the service was really great; breakfast box will be prepared if you are in hurry to airport and have no time to eat breakfast, but you have to request it to the receptionist. meals at the restaurant were varied and delicious. I had a wonderful stay here!"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Koh Wee Liang,5.0,"The hotel is very clean and the service is top notch. The stuff always willing to help with a smile on a daily basis, as expected of a great customer service. The aircon is cold, wifi connection is great, toilet is clean and the bed/pillows are comfortable. All in all, one of the best hotel in Surabaya and one that I will come back again. The only downside for this hotel is wall is not exactly soundproof, noises and conversations from connecting rooms can be heard easily, there are instances when I open the door when the bell of the connecting rooms are pressed. Also the mall connected to the hotel (ciputra mall) is very empty with not much shopping /entertainment/ attractions"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Ayesha Aziz,5.0,"Always a preferred hotel in Surabaya due to its service, comfort, decor, breakfast with gluten free bread.
Hotel is connected to the mall which is a big facility.
After the pandemic, some elements can use renovation like carpets in the room look old, bathrooms can use and upgrade or touch up or a deep cleaning to cover up those corners which are collecting mold now.
Still the high quality of furniture and fixtures speaks of the hotel‚Äôs former glory."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,ZenRYL ReaDy,5.0,"i really love the skyview from infinity pool, their pool had the best view ive had so far among all the hotel in surabaya, and their service is excellent, thank you for staff rendra and baku for guiding me direction to the pool, ps: best photographer u could ever get"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,cis antono,5.0,"5 star hotel located in a big complex of mall, hotel, apartment and office. The hotel entrance is located at the backside of the mall and it has a direct access to the mall also.

The lobby:
Located on the 8th floor. A very clean and spacious lobby gives off the 5 star hotel vibes. Very friendly and helpful staff.

The room:
Great, a 5 star standard. However in my personal view the hotel can design a better design for the backboard of the bed. Amenities are standard, however no hair comb available. The floor is using carpet to minimize footsteps sound. The walls are not soundproof. I can still hear the noise from the next room. AC works well.

The facility:
Located on the 22nd floor. The swimming pool is quite small, but OK if it is not crowded. Gym has decent and complete equipment. They sell gelato also next to the gym.

The restaurant:
Located on the 7th floor. The restaurant is very clean. They served a variety of dishes, from dim sum, noodles, rice, traditional foods etc. The taste is OK but can be improved in my opinion."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Arbella Kusuma,5.0,"Had a great experience staying at Ciputra with my parent and family. Worth every penny! Room is beyond expectation, service is immaculate. Breakfast dishare could be better. Ayam semur and hot ginger are my favorite. Service during breakfast is Excellent especially Erin. Thanks Ciputra Hotel! Will be back."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Fanny PARENGKUAN,5.0,"Staffs are friendly with  excelent services. Excelent product knowledge. Fresh ambience at lobby  with beautiful flower arrangement , love the mascot BOTERO.. keep up the excellent work!!!!"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,thomas a,5.0,"I will tell you guys about my experience 7 days stay at this Hotel.||Best hotel with the worth price.|The staff really helpful and friendly, especially Unggul and Arif.|Breakfast at this hotel is so delicious too.|Room and  bed are comfy too.|Thankyouuuuuuuuu!!"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,„Çå„ÇìÔºàRenÔºâ,2.0,"Pros:
1. attached to Ciputra shopping mall
2. I got upgraded to deluxe room because the standard non smoking room was fully booked
3. friendly staffs

Cons:
1. This hotel is monetizing too much from the parking charge, because if the drop off is more than 5 minutes, langsung kena parkir Rp 10.000.
I was so surprised the parking charge starts from 10.000 instead of 5.000 like in Jakarta. It‚Äôs too expensive, even for Surabaya standard.

2. The food quality and portion for breakfast was not satisfactory.
- the grilled tomato is not grilled at all, and it got funky smell like bau kain lap. I almost throw up when I taste it.
- the potatos only left like 3 pieces, it was not refilled. I had breakfast around 9AM so I wonder why the food has finished already
- same as potatoes, the baked beans also almost finished. And its overcooked.
- the cappuccino cup is sooo small. Not a proper cup for cappuccino. It tastes bland too.

3. The gym has too many gym equipment that it has no space for long mirrors for weightlifting area. This is the first time I found a gym in a hotel (and its a 5 stars hotel) that provide no space for weight lifting. I had to scoop near the wall to find a space.
I mean, not everyone goes to the gym untuk pakai alat only or treadmill only. A gym is supposed to cater all means of working out.

3. The main door for ladies‚Äô toilet and sauna room cannot be closed properly, jadi pintunya selalu agak sedikit terbuka. People need privacy for sauna, so it makes me so uncomfortable.
Plus, the locker is outside the room. It would be more convenient to have a locker inside the room so that we can have more privacy."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,George,1.0,"Very luxurious but dated, the windows are single pane so even on th 19th floor be prepared to enjoy a religious concert at least 4 times a day starting at 4.30 am..Also the walls are very thin, you can hear the telephone ringing from the room next door"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,amir p,5.0,Great Hotel Thanks to Miss Atika from Front desk  who is friendly  and very helpfull.|And also the room were clean and tidy thanks to Ainal|great breakfast and tasty too|near to city and office .....|the room perfect cozy great for relaxing after busy day
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Alhamdi Yosef,5.0,"Good hotel with circle concept, and infinity pool on the rooftop.
Some annoying is odd painting the fat lady in balerina pose, same pose only different angle. Then the elevator has not sound notification when has arrived, so we don't know if the elevator has been come or not if not starely to three elevator door every second."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Ziarini Karmiadji,5.0,"Second stay here every end year holiday. Always superb service. Room is spacious, breakfast is terrific, and staff especially breakfast service staff is tremendously friendly and helpful. Always recommended to stay in Ciwo."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Noor Asyikin Mustaffa,5.0,"Location is centralised and with it being attached to the mall, made it convenient for all guests. The rooms are spacious and bathroom was superb. Service is excellent, as always."

Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Anna Minami,5.0,The Staff is very helpfull and friendly. Got a free room upgrade! The pool view is totally mesmerizing.
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Dory S,5.0,Great hotel with great facilities and excellent service. I got a last-minute upgrade to room 1905 with a city view. The room is clean and big enough for me. Breakfast is great and has many options. They give afternoon tea that's so nice after a hectic meeting all day. It really made my day. thank you for all of the staf for being so helpful and great service
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Ryan Goh,4.0,"The location is ""centrally"" located but not near anything that a tourist would go. luckily taxi is cheap
Hotel facilities is tip top with room furnished well.
The services and smile provided by the staff is great, you truly felt welcome
breakfast selection was great and their staff take an effort to remember which drink do you like to have
to kick-start a good day

housekeeping however is a slight letdown with inconsistency, upon arrival the room was missing certain towel eg face towel. towel type was inconsistent (certain day i have 2 different kind of bath towel which i couldnt differentiate whether its foot towel) , tissue box was not setup properly

overall its still a good stay and would definitely be back"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Andriani Suharto,5.0,"A very nice place to stay in Surabaya. Comfortable bed, very clean room, and fast room service. But the breakfast is not that good and the price for room service food is a bit expensive"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Faizal Ardiansyah,5.0,"Excellent service. 2nd time returning after the rebrand from Grand Mercure.

Front House: easy, seamless, n hassle free check in. Professional n friendly curtesy.

F&B: Excellent food & service quality. A wide range of culinary selection at breakfast, fitting a person like me well who lives abroad seeking a local delicacy back home. A special mention to Sabrila who went the extra mile, making sure we had a great breakfast experience. Also, a very nice surprise knowing that I was entitled to an (proper) afternoon tea. I almost didn't need dinner.

Housekeeping: Excellent bedding n linen quality. I slept well. I have overall enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

One room for improvement when possible; a special attention to the bathroom in regards to stains n mould treatment and prevention as well as the overall maintenance standards. Perhaps a functional, fit for purpose, exhaust system and could help improve this.

Interestingly, I have also seen this across other Accor brands (Novotel, Mercure, Grand Mercure) I've visited in the country. So, I am not sure if it is a generally accepted a rather high tolerance to mould and stains or just an oversight to the housekeeping & maintenance standards at the national/corporate level."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Alex R,5.0,Great stay at the Movenpick. I had a fantastic meal in the restaurant. Vidi helped me to pick some local dishes and explained the food to me as I had never been to Indonesia before. Great service and perfect recommendations by him. I look forward to visiting again
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Jessica S.,4.5,"I had spent 6 Nights here with my family.
They had high occupancy due to peak season of holiday.
But their staff still accommodate our needs very well.
Thank you for all the hard work of the hotel team member."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,5.0,"bromo sewu Stayed for a day after returning home from fun. It was great. The breakfast was rich. It was very thrilling to go out and cross the roadüòé. There was a big shopping mall nearby, not the one next door! ! It's also close to the airport, less than 30 minutes by taxi."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Nario Anggoro,5.0,A really great hotel with a very nice interior. The interior was well maintained and tidy. There were swimming pool and gym with treadmill & several weight lifting equipment. The only minor disadvantage was location which located around 5 km from city center. But it was located very near to the bus stop.
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Didik K,5.0,"VERY CLEAN, WELL DESIGNED. Large size room, giant size bed, clean, comfort. Windows are great sound proofed, so traffic noise doesn't matter at all. Breakfast quality is decent. Thanks to restaurant staff Ms Dhea for serving us very very well. Location is a bit far from city center"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Masniaritta Pohan,5.0,"Hotel is really nice, clean, and comfortable. The staff is extremely helpful. Shout out to Miss Nurul Fida who always ready to help which makes my stay at Movenpick memorable."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Sin Tee Jeremy Beh,5.0,"Great hotel ever with nice room which I has been upgraded to a bigger room.

We had last minutes dinner at the 7th floor and the Staff name Miss Nova was very attentive and providing an excellent service as they almost closing. Semhe even served us the fruits platter as she knew her kitchen chef will take longer time to cook our food. All the time, she came and check on us and make sure we are comfortable. Thumbs uo for Miss Nova and she deserved a compliment from customer. And credit to her. BRAVO.....
I saw her in the next day morning breakfast and she greeted me again with warm welcome and make my day with a smile!
Good job, Miss Nova and hope to see you soon."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Ega Widjaja,5.0,"Great Stay at Movenpick Surabaya. Very clean, comfortable, and luxurious rooms. Very good breakfasts. Friendly staff. Special thanks to the staff at the breakfast restaurant for providing personalized service for us because of our Platinum membership. Easy check in and check out process and great value for money. The only downsides of this hotel is I think the parking space is a bit cramped and the gym is quite limited for a 5-star hotel.
We would love to come back to stay here again."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Timotius Wibowo,5.0,"This review is for the Patita restaurant at M√∂venpick. Had a buffet dinner there during Christmas.

Food: Was worth it for the price of the buffet. Taste was decent and the variety was within expectation.

Service: the staff were friendly. They were very prompt and very attentive to guests. Some junior staff members seems new to the job and less knowledgeable about their offerings but this doesn't detract from the clear passion and dedication to service that they have.

Ambiance: The Patita restaurant has good and tasteful interiors."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,App App,5.0,"The room is very comfort with city view from 11th floor. Breakfast is a lot of menus and Happy with thematic lebaran menu lontong cap gomeh also kids food popcorn, rambut nenek. Overall is great and highly recommended to stay here"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Tegar Ilma Noor,5.0,"First time visit surabaya and we are lucky enough to get a room In movenpick hotel even in the  peak holiday season..overall the hotel, the room, services, and breakfast menu was  great. Such a pleasure experience. Sure enough we will visit agaain next time."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Firstian Kautsar Adiguno,5.0,"Movenpick Surabaya City is the first Movenpick hotel that I stayed, ever. The pre-arrival communication went well, my request was very well accommodated. During check-in, I was told about the hotel's situation and facilities. As a Platinum member, they escorted me into my room, what a welcome!
Welcome cake and fruit are already on the table, and room AC is already on.
Afternoon High Tea is offered as a complimentary benefit, to substitute the absences of the hotel lounge. The options are offered via phone, directly when I arrive in the room. It will be delivered to the room whenever I am ready.
Options were quite generous and the snacks were delicious. I came during Ramadhan, so the snacks were considered a pre-Iftar meal (takjil).

I tried the small gym and relaxed at the poolside while waiting for the Iftar time. At night I took a welcome drink at the bar, but the options were not that much (coffee, tea, and juice only).

Since it's Ramadhan I took sahur meal instead of breakfast. While the options are limited, I can enjoy a freshly brewed tea that is offered by the assistant. Very well assured they acknowledged their elite member.

Check-out situation went fast and no drama to end my short 1-night stay in this brand new hotel (reformed from Grand Mercure, previously).
Still curious to feel the full breakfast experience and (hopefully) when the new lounge is ready. See you!"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Jogja English.Magazines,5.0,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights, and it was a very satisfying experience. The room was clean, the service was excellent, the breakfast was good, the check-in process was smooth, and it was a relatively new hotel, so the bedding and towels were in good condition. In particular, I would like to thank Mr.Dimas, who works at the restaurant, and I would like to thank him again for being able to stay comfortably and happily throughout my stay with such kind and thoughtful service. If I have a chance, I would like to visit the hotel again."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Jason Tan,5.0,"Had a delightful supper experience at Patita restaurant during the late hours. The staff Miss Nova, displayed excellent customer service and sincere welcome that make my day."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Marlin (Bre),5.0,"The staff are just amazing. Cicik, Vida and Dimas, they are completely helpful and super kind during my 3-night stay there. They asked what I fancy for the following day breakfast, then on the morning everything was ready. Superrrrrb‚Ä¶ They never skipped asking how my stay felt like, what need to be improved to satisfy the experience.

Also, the receptionist team did a great job, helped me reschedule the booking time; Not a automatic machine talking on the phone.

Will certainly recommend this hotel to everyone while lookin for accomodation in Surabaya. The room is super cozy and convenient."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,3.0,"The hotel is very noisy, and there is a place like an amusement park below. People sing until midnight, which is very uncomfortable for those who go to bed early. The sheets are not clean either, there are a lot of mud spots that haven't been cleaned"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,4.5,"The location is ok. On the one side of the hotel there is a small convenient store, on the other side there is an old small shopping center (Hollowed) which comes with a few eateries. Royal Plaza has more food choices but it takes 15-18 minutes walk and you have to go around to pass the railway tracks to get there. The traffic at the railway intersection is very bad so you better to take Grab to go to Royal Plaza. The room is clean and room size is ok. The TV is good size and has good programs. There is a safe box, but no bathtub in the room I stayed. The buffet breakfast and dinner are ok. The AC at the dining area is not cold enough. The staff are friendly and helpful. The train tracks are very close to the hotel so don‚Äôt choose the rooms that face the tracks if you prefer quiet environment."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,hanif syauqi,5.0,"Awesome.. The Hospitality is best, Foods are delicious, recommended for Ramadan Staycation.. Enjoy, relax & happy.. Thank u for your service Miss NOVA (F&B) @Patita Restaurant 7th floor"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Stephen Christian,2.0,"Staff is friendly and willing to listen to complain.
Check in was easy but elevator is having long queue (understandable for holiday period)
Entering the room, room is spacious but toilet is smelly. You can hear water sound from other room as well as bell sound from other room. Toilet is smelly, hand towel and shower cap only available upon request BUT room phone is not working.
What troublesome the most is PARKING. Since parking is limited, hotel provides valet. But 2 times I use it, two times i need to wait my car for long period when collecting since it blocked by other car (for sure one occassion they say my car is blocked by other car  that didnt use valet service). You can imagine if the owner of the car taking nap or go swimming, how can I collect my car?!
I did complain directly to hotel but only received by MOD as duty manager is not available."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,3.7,The first room we got had many ants so we were given another nicer room. The room was spacious and comfortable with amazing bathtub. The only concern is the cleanliness of the hotel which could be improved so as to live up to 4 - 5 stars standard.
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Jonathan J,4.0,"Hotel design and rooms are very tastefully decorated and looks modern yet inviting. Location wise is not in the most central location of Surabaya but pretty well accessible. Only downside is there's a train track right across the hotel so you'd hear clearly when there's a train passing. Hotel has clear potentials but lacking some finesse like some dirty walls in the room, very used and torn towels (didn't feel very comfortable using it), and the sink faucet that sprays water everywhere every time you use it. Hope it can be improved."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Wattson 88,5.0,"I left and lost my wallet at the lobby toilet.
Within 2 hours, the hotel staff and security traced it and found.. Great hospitality and responsibility. All the stuff back to me. Thanks alot, superb!!"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,4.5,"Needed to pay extra for highway fee to the hotel, not far from the airport. Hotel was standardised 5 star hotel and the food portion at the restaurant was big and inexpensive! Enjoy our dinner there!"
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,4.0,"nearby airport , 30mint distance from airport . room is beautiful n comfortable but the tower is dirty ,breakfast is not tasty . service is great . overall this hotel not matching with 5 star , consider 4 star hotel ."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Lilir Bali,5.0,"The breakfast is huge variety, and so tasty. The room and the view is nice."
M√∂venpick Surabaya City,Yulia Natania,5.0,"I appreciate the small to medium-sized hotel. The rooms are modern, clean, and spacious. However, the swimming pool is small, and the breakfast is just okay."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.6,No issues and pleasant place to stay. Front office staff and friendly and knowledgeable. Makes things smooth.Please review the bathroom mold and shower heads. Most of the heads are broken and sprayed in wild directions. And shower heads are moldy.Will visit again
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.6,Shower area cleanliness can be further improved. Specifically ‚Ä¶ molds and damaged shower head. I have stayed in this hotel in the past. Roaches were crawling all over in the room. But I don‚Äôt see them anymore. Congrats for taking care of this pest problem. Will consider Great Diponegoro hotel again in future visits.
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.6,"Nice, it's just that the parking lot is full, always manage it yourself... at an affordable price you can get a good hotel like this, overall very satisfied, thanks trip.com"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.5,"Comfortable, very good, can you get a room on the 11th floor, you can see the view of the city of Surabaya, service is also ok, cleanliness is ok"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Selvia Chan,5.0,"Went there bcz of a wedding invitation. A small but located in the heart of the city - hotel. Staffs are friendly. Toilet are quiet clean. They were very responsive as at my friend's wedding. They take the dirty plate as long as wes finished eat. So theres no mess everywhere.
But the parking lot are very hard to find. We have to park at the street - which are very dangerous. Their lift are so small and a bit slow."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Harry Kalsumajaya,4.0,"Though bedsheets some rooms may seem yellowish, the cleanliness of the rooms is still acceptable. Decent breakfast at the decent location. Parking wise may be cramped, but looking at the rate of the hotel, this hotel gives a proper satisfaction for tenants to sleep through the night without worry. Well recommended at its price."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Very clean hotel, location is also very suitable for looking for food at night"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Irwan Fithrony,5.0,"Love the suite room, so comfy, love the couch, so clean, if the bathroom lil bit spacy it will be great. Hopes they'll upgrade their food taste, that will be great as same with their hotel name."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.7,"Lovation is good, near kfc and indomaret.. Too bad on the second day the water is dirty üòû"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,KoIn Company,5.0,"Staff here were super kind.
Room was good and cheap."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Samsul Ishak,4.0,A night stay in between journey. Small room but served the purpose. Good location.
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,K B,5.0,"Great value! Very clean rooms with comfortable beds, cold AC & hot showers. We had one night between hiking volcanos in Java and flying to Thailand so this was a great place to relax and get a good nights sleep. It‚Äôs less than a 10 minute drive to the Tunjugan Plaza mall and there are some good restaurants nearby."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Richfield Seven,4.0,"The location is good because it is in the city center. Close to malls and other public facilities. Right next door to a mini mart and fast food restaurant. It's just that breakfast is not good and the price of milk ordered to be delivered to the room can change at any time. There is no bell boy to help carry our luggage. Parking ramps are slippery when it rains and parking spaces are very limited. The room is less soundproof from the hallway, next room and traffic around the hotel. But, the room rate is very affordable."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Ariesta Wibisono Anditya,5.0,"Despite the compact-sized building, the value still incomparable to other hotels around. Cleanliness, hospitality, the offered entertainment, food & beverages are valuable."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.5,"The suit type rooms are really recommended, the prices are very cheap for the suit type & view, standard service, cleanliness, SOP, right?"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Dew Yo,1.0,"Salah satu resepsionis yang kerja shift handle operational jam 12.00 - 14.00 tanggal 17 August 2023, have such a bad gesture. Kerja di hospitality tapi lack of say sorry and thank you. Bad to know we have such a bad experience from her."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.5,"Not the first time ya stay here. But the longer it takes, the worse it gets. The staff is a bit unfriendly. In terms of cleanliness, it's already lacking, now it's getting worse. Dirty sheets. Kettles and glasses dusty. There are cockroaches. Wifi off2. And maybe you can add a swimming pool. There is a deposit for the key of 50k. The checkout process is a bit long, especially when you're already in line, it's like there's not enough employees. At night there is no security and the hallway is a dark room."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.5,"The hotel is clean, the service is also good, it's just that the rooms are a bit cramped and not soundproof, so you can still hear it from outside to the room and also like playing songs that make it annoying."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,5.0,"I've stayed there several times, it's still good and it doesn't disappoint at all. Clean, smell good, cold ac, fast wifi, good view, clean bathroom, all the amenities are very good."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,juan wong,2.0,"The room is not clean. I found bugs. There's a leak from the air conditioner. Above the AC, there is waterways, which result noises during almost a long night. Breakfast ok, but not so tasty, it is probably during the fasting period."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Call To Glory,5.0,"I love this hotel. The room is spacious and clean, the bathroom is clean too, the city view is also very beautiful. The price is cheap and the breakfast is not bad. The location is strategic, only 14 minutes from Pasar Turi station, next to KFC and near minimarket."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.1,"This hotel is at center of the city, near awesome place and many transportation available here. The place is cozy, enjoyable, cheap, service is good, and comfortable. The room is clean, receptionist always ready, and have some facility at upstairs. I haven't enjoy the room service because this is month of fasting, but one day i will. Keep the good service."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Lidwina Arin,5.0,"Excellent location, there is KFC across the street, and next to Indomaret point with BCA and BNI ATM service. Easy access to Tunjungan Plaza. The staff is also friendly. I spent 2 nights here and it was such a pleasant moment. There is welcome drink, you can choose either coffee or tea in their rooftop bar. The view in rooftop bar is so pretty especially in the dusk if the sky is clear. The room is comfy too and not spooky."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Rahmat J,5.0,"Didn't know what to expect, I booked one night. Boy, how regretful I was. Wish I stayed longer. ||Bed & pillow were super comfortable. And the surprise? BOLSTER...! I immediately feel at  home & indeed, I slept like baby.||AC was okay, but the hot water pressure was consistently great, and it made my ritual of hot shower before going to bed perfectly kept.||One thing I noticed is how the attention to detail is given to ensure the cleanliness is kept around the clock. 4 times I went to the public toilet and the seat is ALWAYS dry and clean. Yes, I have an serious case of OCD & yet I can't fault the cleanliness.||Although a bit dark in Reception desk, Putri the receptionist is always eager to assist. The others need to learn from her professional hospitality attitude. Lobby is small but functional. The Hall meeting room is spacious. My meeting arrangement was easily accommodated and professionally well taken care of by Freshi Moreno. A big thank you for extending your flexibility toward my changing meeting arrangement need.||Breakfast selection was varied & satisfying but the group's loud chatters turned off my  appetite slightly.||Location is great, rate is affordable but at  product this good it should've fetched a few more rupiah. ||Concussion: Stay here. Period. Highly recommended."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,G Andika,5.0,"Only spent a night for a transit in Surabaya and really love the place. The room was nice, though not very spacious. Had various breakfast selections and really enjoyed the meal served‚Äîlove the way they handle the meats. The staffs were so helpful and hospitable. It's also easy to access many parts of the city from here."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Harry Ryana,5.0,"Decent place for transit hotel. Room is comfortable. AC working ok. Great location. Near KFC, Indomaret and other interesting place. Although limited breakfast choice but the taste is really good.  Stay on superior room with connecting door and enough space for my family."

Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Ernestine O. Yuniswara,4.0,"Stayed for one night company meetings. Decent room overlooking Jalan Diponegoro, too bad mine smelled like cigarette. Friendly & helpful staff. Nice rooftop dining hall, great for a change of view."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,k drama f,5.0,"The hotel is strategically located nearby a small shopping mall. There is an art shop next to it as well. There are a lot of restaurants around the hotel.||The parking area is spacious as the hotel is using the parking space of the mall.||My family was greeted upon reaching the lobby and the receptionist was friendly and informative. Parking is free by showing the parking coupon provided by the receptionist.||There is free coffee with coffee machine (similar to nespresso) available at the lobby.||Luggages were delivered to my room promptly even though it was during the hari raya period.||First impression of the room: Spacious and clean! It is not easy to find spacious hotel at this price nowadays.||My son fell sick during my stay and lucky enough that this Artotel is very close to a big hospital i.e. Mayapada Hospital. My family can move swiftly from the hospital to the hotel and vice versa.||We booked 2 rooms for 3 nights each (booked through Agoda, but regretted it as booking through official website was much cheaper T.T). Due to my son‚Äôs hospitalisation incident, i was allowed to rearranged my booking to 1 room for 2 nights and 1 room for 4 nights. This helped my family a lot as we needed to stay a bit longer in Surabaya. The management was very kind to to it for us.||Room was completed with bath tub and separate bathroom and toilet.||Overall, we enjoyed our stay there. Thanks so much Artotel :)"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,refi x,3.0,"The CEO Suite Room was the best decision. It only has one bedroom but with a very open space balcony. It's an experience like living in 1 big room apartment with full furnished, huge living room, mini kitchen, and you can invite some friends to meet privately. We love the ambience room. ||For deluxe room are just fine. ||But a little unconvenient, for the empty space and dark floor on the 2nd - 3rd floor which sometimes open even we don't press the button. And the exterior building need a retouch. It's actualy a nice hotel. So, it might looks spooky for some ppl.||Fyi, the hotel was opposite to KFC. But quite far to Tunjungan Plaza.||Oh, not forget to mention, We got excellent service from Mr Ano for the information of the hotel, bringing our bag just in time, and make us feel comfort with the hotel, thank you. ||Anw, If you buy the room from apps, please reconfirm to the hotel before checking in, it might be a different room. ||Hope to see you in a better face Artotel TS Suite üíñ Thank you for your service."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Wijaya K,4.0,"one of my favourite hotel in surabaya. since i celebrate my birthday here, the hotel management gave me a slice of birthday cake and the room is decorated very nice. i really appreciate it.|unfortunately, the pillow sheet is a little bit smelly. the breakfast taste is so so"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Howard G,4.0,"The room is spacious and clean. |Some things I‚Äôd like to highlight are:|- There were no welcome drinks upon arrival.|- The fitness center is closed. |For a city hotel without a swimming pool, alternative facilities for guests should be considered.||This place just needs some care and attention. It has a lot of potential, with friendly staff at the front desk and in the breakfast restaurant."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.1,"Really worth the price!!!This is a 4 star hotel but felt like a 5 star! The room was clean, wide, nice interior and got a clean bath tub!! It got separated shower and toilet and amenities were complete. I'm not even sure I will get the same benefit from a 5-star around here.Breakfast buffet had lots of choices with decent taste. Coffee was very nice!!They also had a gym room and a bar. Service was also nice and helpful. Definitely will come back again!"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.0,"The location is good, with affordable prices. First check in the hotel staff not informed us about the facilities and breakfast time, etc but it‚Äôs fine. We stayed for 2 nights, after the 1st night the hotel texted me and informed us to move to another room because our floor have regular maintenance (they even didn‚Äôt mention it during our check in). The 2nd night we moved to the other room but the key is not working ü•π we have to back and forth to the reception still didn‚Äôt work, the hotel staff asked to move to another room üò™. The room is not too clean as I still can see the dust in some areas, and the toilet was leaking, quite disappointed. Hope they can improve the service and maintenance"

ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.7,"No swimming pool, but have bath tub. Each room has carpet, just it seems so worn out. The service is so so. As understood there is flexibility on check-out time, but only for direct customer. Breakfast is ok, many variety, just need to be more tasty."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Paul Basuki,5.0,Love it.. The room is very spacious and the bathroom is great too. Breakfast is very nice too with many varieties on offer. Only the TV is very old and too small for today standard.
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.7,"Wow, I'm really excited to be staying here. Starting to check in was very slow. Had to wait half an hour for the room to be ready, even though it was already 3 o'clock. Room cleanliness was lacking, the bed covers and towels smelled musty. The restaurant is hot, I don't know what the concept is without air conditioning."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Arlinka Larissa,3.0,"Update: They refunded my second night and took action swiftly to rectify their mistakes. Please continue improving.

‚Äî

Room was old, so were all the furnitures and amenities such as pillows and towels (they were greying). My second night, there was a power outage and even though the hotel staff tried to be helpful, they didn‚Äôt give a satisfactory solution, instead transferring me to a nearby hotel of worse quality. Probably management troubles, but it was a major inconvenience for me during a tiring business trip. If not for the power outage saga, I would‚Äôve given it 3 stars."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,elsyaaa,5.0,"The staff at Artotel Surabaya are commendable for their professionalism and friendliness, providing excellent service throughout my stay. Custumer service excellence ||However, there is a notable issue with the strong fragrance in the hallways and elevator, which can be overwhelming and cause headaches. ||Overall, while the staff's performance is exemplary, improvements are needed regarding the intensity of the fragrance in the common areas."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Aziz A,4.0,"Good and comfortable room, clean bath room and very helpful staf.|It will be better if :|A. There is a hanger for towel/s|B.

ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Karel Pramono,4.0,Came to this hotel for a piano competition held at their ballroom. Reception was very helpful yo our question for directions to the ballroom. Some unique arts on display when we were there. Parking is a bit sketchy -- but not was a major issue.
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Frederik Cavadino,4.0,"As 1 of only a handful hotels in SBY with a bath tub we booked it for it's spacious and affordable room and being in a good area. Newly renovated, very friendly staff and the fun room with a sliding wall totally opening up the bathroom to the bedroom, such that you sit in the bath in the middle of the room looking out over SBY skyline made it special. Few remarks..... lighting switches have a strange set up; from the bed it is either all lights on or off. Adn near the bathroom a switch for all lights in bathroom on or off. Not handy as you light up the whole room, waking your partner, during a mid-night toilet break. Also; it will provide some preferred privacy to make the glass in the toilet door non-transparent. Breakfast was good; they were still busy renovating this area. Note to hotel; make sure your egg-baking cook wears clean clothes..... Overall, definitely value for money and a great place to stay in SBY."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Nicholas Pratama,3.0,"I made a booking for this 4-star hotel that had a high rating of 9.0 on Agoda. However, upon arriving at the hotel, I was disappointed to find that the room did not meet my expectations. Although the room was spacious, it was inadequately lit, and I could see spots of dust on the furniture. The bathroom had moldy patches, and the quality of the linen was subpar. I couldn't help but wonder if the hotel was located in an old, unused mall or some other abandoned building. The only redeeming qualities of the hotel were the size of the room and the staff's hospitality."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Second experience staying here. always satisfying, really worth it, friendly service, got a spacious room, big bath, clean, comfortable room, there is a coffee machine, refrigerator, no problems at all. Even though there's no swimming pool, it's no problem. Only this second stay I was disappointed with the breakfast dishes, this time it didn't taste as good as the first stay, all the menus tended to be bland, some even had saltiness. Meanwhile, at the first breakfast, almost everything on the menu was delicious"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.6,"Spacious rooms, spacious bathrooms, large bathtubs, complete amenities. There are quite a lot of food variations but the taste is just ordinary. The room is not soundproof so the sound of music from outside or the sound of other guests closing the door can be heard loudly"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,MF Worker Guide Sam (Febri),5.0,"I visited the hotel for a scientific dental discussion. Artotel surely at different 4-star level as expected.
Next to the hotel is the Sutos. Sutos used to be very crowded, active place before pandemic, now it's bit abandoned with only 3-5 vendors left."

ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Ellen Setiawan,2.0,"Honestly a good location and the staff is really nice. Chose this hotel because it was close to Mayapada hospital and the staff provided us extra bedding to make us feel comfortable after surgery. However, we stayed here for 6 nights and all 6 nights and days there was loud music blasting from the mall below which made existence just unbearable in our room. Also all the towels and sheets are very old and no longer white. Bathroom fixtures can be updated."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.0,basic hotel in surabaya. fine for 2 nights. the tub is nice but the water doesn‚Äôt get very hot. the towels are really old and quite smelly. couch is also quite old and dirty. wifi is mostly decent. air con is super loud. toilet fan also really loud

ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.7,the room is spacious and got a room on the top floor so the city view is good. only for cleanliness it is still lacking because there is some dust on the carpet and there are cutouts of coffee sachets next to the room
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Tanti Kusriandini,5.0,"The bathroom was so nice. Love the design & cleanliness.
The details were the best :
1. put on smaller size of tiles on the shower room to avoid slippery floor
2. Textured wall on the shower room
3. Provide coffee capsule

Nothing special on breakfast, just usual menu with a fewer kind of fruits

Overall its a pleasant stay!"

ASTON INN Jemursari,Maria Lanovia,4.0,"Clean and modern interior. Great location, affordable. Nice touch by providing Google Home Nest.

Things can be improved:
1. Improve the room maintenance. My shower drain clogged. I needed to pull it up to let the water flew.
2. Towels looked old as well. Can be replaced.
3. Breakfast spread was okay, although some hot foods served cold.
4. Called receptionist 3x to ask about the sink, but didn‚Äôt get the response. I went down to talk to them directly and they apologised bcs they were attending other check in guests"
ASTON INN Jemursari,Ari Saptawijaya,4.0,"Good price. Smart room with Google Nest. We came on Jan 2nd, unfortunately the swimming pool was not yet cleaned, where rest of small paper on the surface and the bottom of the ppol (like those popped from confetti or fireworks). Perhaps it was from the New Year's party. Parking is rather limited with free valet provide, where you have to leave your car's key with them."
