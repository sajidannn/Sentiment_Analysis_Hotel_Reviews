ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Felicia Gunardi,3.0,"We tried this hotel cause my hubby need to do something nearby. We took junior suite 2BR while there was promotion price. The room quite big with 2 bedroom but only 1 bathroom outside the bedroom and quite old. There also kitchen and living room. It's quite clean but unfortunately I found live cockroach near the sink kitchen. They also give you obly empty jar to fill in the water dispenser outside room. The service quite oke except when in breakfast time my son want to take some food, the waiter didn't allow because need to photo it first. While the food in breakfast just usual variation but doesn't taste too good. The location is quite oke, in the middle of the busy district but it also means a lot traffic."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,M Ang,2.0,"Hotel is south area .
Staff is nice But dont speak english so quite difficult to communicate.
The bed is confortable but a lot of mosquitos in the room and lobby a total nightmare...
No safe in the room...
Breakfast is simple nothing special , no coffee machine juste bad coffee serve.for the same price I recommand Ibis much better quality ..."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Diandra Harun,1.0,The worst service experience ive ever encountered in Jkt. Asked for extra 2 pillows as my husband is sick and we are willing to pay but they refuse. Asked to speak to their manager  and waited for 15 minutes and doesnt even want to come out to see me. Wont be recommending this place to any of my family or friends in indo or malay. And im still staying here til this Sunday wish us luck 😭
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,1.0,"This is the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. I couldn't get in after checking in at night. My colleague and I went up and down the x3 times to reset the card and ended up still the same! The bed in the room was dirty and the room was dark! What's even more exaggerated is that the power supply in my room was cut off at 8am in the morning, and then the hotel receptionist told me to restart it myself! I paid at this high price to live in a place like a public toilet!"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Bella Salsha,5.0,"I was booked for Iftar Reservation at Aston Belvenue Radio Dalam, it was a great experience to enjoy Indonesian food at one time, good and pleasant service when meeting Ainul, and fast response with Rifai, to fulfill all our needs when iftar time, an unforgettable moment, thank you Aston Belvenue"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,FandiStevee,1.0,"I went to the spa just for relaxing my tired body but the therapist forced me to get happy ending massage which I don’t want to and she keep asking me for happy ending.. so if you guys looking for happy ending massage, feel free to ask the therapist."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Tabi,1.0,"They didnt change their bed sheets or something
I have to ask for a new room twice to at least get a decent but still not the cleanest bed sheet
I found a pubic hair looking thing in the 1st room
And in the 2nd room they gave me twin bed with sheets full of stains
Never had this kind of experience in a 4 star hotel
This brand is known for being great
But this particular branch is not good"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Buyung Baskoro,4.0,"Room was good. Food was okay, but restaurant needed more cleanliness standard. Overall, experience was great."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,arome,2.0,"the staff are not so friendly. Most of the hotel I have booked in my whole life allow check in before 2pm, but for the first time i wait from 1:30 pm till 2pm and still need to wait for 15 min because the room is being vaccum."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Chris Andrew (Andrew),3.0,"Came here for a business meeting. The location of this hotel is very strategic, just a couple of minutes walk from a shopping center named Pondok Indah Mall (PIM). To be fair the experience was quite okay and nothing went wrong during my visit.

However, in my opinion, this hotel did not meet my expectations of the ASTON brand. The main reason for this is because the food selection here is very limited and actually have a so so taste. Definitely nothing special. In addition, the pool here is very small and also car parking here is quite difficult. Not a lot of parking space and very difficult to enter as the basement ramp is very narrow."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Mario Sales,1.0,"Here I am again to review this hotel. Despiste my extremely bad experience before, due to my office location, this is the best choice to avoid endless time in traffic jams. Maybe better to accept the fact that traffic is part of daily life in Jakarta then to accept that a 4 star hotel (?????) is completly mis-functional. I am currently at the hotel and all the same problems as reported before are still there (here) although the promise of the General Manager that they would be looked at. Nothing happened in more than one month, or at least nothing visible for a guest happened. I am currently in a situation where the AC has been leaking for the whole day. Technicians were called 2 times and problem still remains, with an extra ""interesting"" addendum to the story that the ceiling is starting to crack, putting our safety at risk. Manager was called and the solution is to move to a similar room without no compensation (read, a room upgrade) to at least make a client happier (not happy) after such an unpleasant and hazzardous experience. We will start to pack all our stuff and move and then unpack in the new (read, newly assigned) room.

To finalize, picking up on Mr. Benny C Karambut (General Manager): ""Should you reconsider staying with us again, we'd appreciate the opportunity to provide you with a much-improved experience that aligns with the quality and standards associated with Aston hotels"". You are far far far away from that Mr. Benny!"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Tari Zen,5.0,"Best food in the town near area pondok indah mall,with nice ambience and food and service mas Bilal was excellent.
Very kind and fast"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Good location, but facilities are old. The elevator speed is slow and irritating. If you're okay with a cheap hotel, then I think it's a good hotel."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Daphne Wong A Foe (DWAF.),1.0,"Very bad experience.
*You do not get treated like a customer. I had to carry all my bags and suitcases by myself (as an Indonesian-LOOKING girl), but when I was with my (bule) foreigner husband they carried his bags for him. Racists!!!
*the door men/bell boys (2!!) just stood there and did not even help or open the door as it's their job - they couldn't even speak one word of English.
*The lady behind the lobby desk could not speak English as well and was very rude.
*On top of that I had to pay PARKING for my taxi DROP-OFF that lasted less than 1 second - and no one could explain to me why or how that would make sense in any world.
*The rooms are VERY DARK - lighting is bad, deco is old-fashioned. But one light keeps blinking on and off. Horrible when you need to sleep.
*Plus you cannot sleep as there is always music playing in the hallway.
*In the morning they CALL your room (while trying to sleep after terrible nights) to ask what time you want room service - while my sign is on ""do not disturb/no cleaning"" 🙃 When I asked why they called they couldn't answer ofcourse. Terrible headache after that!!
*The gym is one small room, with one machine.
NOT WORTH MY MONEY - I DECLARE A REFUND!!!!"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Aulia Rizkia,5.0,What a perfect place to stay and held a bridal shower event with friends! It was a extremendous night and we were surprised by the beautiful decoration in our rooms from the hotel management. Thankyou for the great services!
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,5.0,It was a good hotel! Very impressive. Plenty of shops nearby and walking distance to Pondok Indah Mall!
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,2.0,"Requested for high floor, but given 2nd floor. For 2 nights not able to available, till 3rd then move to 6th floor. Poor Bathroom design, little space to stand when closing the door and not able to close properly. Bedsheets is not very clean. The chair got a cigarette burn. Breakfast range is not good, coffee taste ok. Should be classified as 3 Stars rather than 4 Stars. Plus is the staffs and door man are friendly."

ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Pathiusman Ashiq,3.0,Decent hotel. Breakfast buffet was chaotic as the restaurant is full and the staff did not show me a table.
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Shanti Dwita Lestari,5.0,"Comfortable bed and tasty breakfast. Pros : they serve asparagus soup on breakfast buffet
Cons: salad and fruit could be improved,  already prepared in small portions, mostly lettuce and shredded carrot"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,4.0,The hotel is quite cleanGood serviceThe room is big enough for a familyWill stay here again for the same purpose 🥰
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Natharine A,3.0,A little disappointed because the closet is dirty n the hairdryer can’t working properly. The front desk don’t stand by so we must waiting to checking in. But overall good for the bed and the cleanliness. Maybe in the future the staff must double check for the room first
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Lita Shahzaman,5.0,"Very happy with the hotel , friendly staff and good food /bfast ."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,4.0,"One of the standout features was the excellent value for the price. I felt that the rates were reasonable and provided great bang for the buck, especially considering the spacious accommodations."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Teguh Bintang Nugraha,3.0,"1. Missing toothbrush amenities
2. Room wasn't ready at 2 PM as scheduled, me, my wife and my 3 month baby waiting for around 15 minutes.
3. I can't do late checkout, receptionist asked if I want to extend or not, then I answer No, then I asked can I do late checkout, she then answer they fully booked, SO WHY ASK EXTENSION IN THE FIRST PLACE IF ALREADY FULLY BOOKED ? please don't lie and just reject my late checkout request!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Rina Tanjung,5.0,"Check in desk prompt, nice and helpful. Overall the staffs are polite and proactively. Gym is considered good and spacious. Pool is small and just nice for kids to play around. Breakfast is also okay and various. No complaint on the taste. Only when we stayed, hotel was quite crowded in the restaurant and seat fully occupied for breakfast. On our last day, Ms. Dewinta came to our table during breakfast, requested politely for a guest review. With a friendly gesture, she listened to our all comments. At the end she served us with a complementary tuna sandwich. Overall this hotel is recommended, good location nearby the exit toll, parking lot is available."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Mitha Novita,5.0,"Been couple times staying in Mercure Hotel  and enjoyed the stay very much. What I like the most is the White Rock Terrace restaurant.  They serve unique pizza and I was lucky enough to try it when having business trip in Jakarta.  Cz now the menu has been out so I cannot eat it again.
But I always like the ambience of the restaurant,  very cozy and comfortable to hang out and enjoy the lunch with my friends. The nicest waitresses is Ms Abigail who is kind and patient to serve us. Definitely I will come back again for my next trip!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Danny,1.0,"I had 2 different booking for consecutive stays.
The first booking is from 22 to 24 April without breakfast. The second one is from 24 to 27 April with breakfast. I had specifically told the Front Officer to make the room 3003 continuous stay, and she said she would take care of it. 

However during my stay with my Business Partner, the FO called our room on 24 April, asking what time we would check out. After 3pm on the same day (24 April), all of our cards were inactive and I had to ask my Business Partner to help change the cards at the Receptionist. Still, on the same day, our room was knocked so loudly while we were taking a rest (read: SLEEPING), the staff asked whether we would extend or check out. Like where's the manner? 

When I checked out at the 27 April, I told the FO regarding the incidents and he casually told me that it occurred because I had 2 different bookings. Excuse me, this is not the first time I had this kind of stay (1 continuous stay with more than 1 booking and it was smooth without reactivating or changing to another keys).

Really unacceptable."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Deutsch m,5.0,"I would like to say thank you so much to Mbak Ayu for her kindness to serve us. She always gives her best so that we can feel comfortable enyoing our food. ||That is one reason why we like to spend our time here, enyoing the morning with warmth. And that is such a blessing. ||And thank you for your service too, Mbak Della. We really enjoyed our lunch. ||Keep up the good work. ||Regards|Rotua Elisabeth"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,타루,5.0,"This hotel is so good. Reasonable price, fantastic facilities and services. And also so kind all staff as well. Especially one of staff Miss Mira was so nice and professional. I strongly recommend this hotel to you. Just try to eat the various and delicious breakfast and take a rest in this hotel while you stay."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Felix L,4.0,I arrived late. Really late. This is my second stay in the hotel. The back entrance to the hotel was closed during the night so you have to drive through the front entrance. ||||Check in was smooth. The room was really wonderful. Well thought out. It had everything I needed and was super comfortable and quiet. I would choose this hotel again should I have early meeting in the area. Keep up the good work.
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Ignatius Aldo,3.0,"So far the hotel is great, but in terms of experience it can be better. I feel the staff friendliness, professionalism and attitude can be improve especially at the breakfast place, some stuff is really do the effort but some quite not so."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,astari w,4.0,"Alhamdulillah , the hotel is very good in room condition and the hospitality. The bedroom is Very roomy and clean. And Thank you to ms. Iza the front officer, very helpfull. Good work for Mercure Hotel. Hopefully we could back in here soon, insyaaAllah"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Alfred Tan,3.0,"The hotel just beside the busy highway and the room window also not sound proof, I really got problem to sleep on the first night and need to request for room change middle of the night. The second room that allocated facing another side of the highway still noisy, but at least the noise is not as heavy compared to the first room.

The coffee machine in privilege room has been removed, but their website not updated and the welcome amenities also replaced with so call executive lounge, but in actual fact it’s only a snack corner just behind the east wing lift area. The access is by using the voucher given and only 1 time access per stay as per their RDM told me.

As an Accor Plus Platinum member,  sorry to say that I don’t really recommend this hotel with this kind of room conditions."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Philly Chen,5.0,"Nice place, in the ground floor of Mercure hotel and very convenience for people staying here.
Fair price with good foods and drinks. Pizza is recommended.
Service is good and basically they all can understand English.
Tropical environment and SE asia decoration."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Adam Shamsudin,5.0,"Perfect hotel with nice and clean room. Staff are all friendly and extremely accommodating to guests. Highly recommend to hang out at the White Rock Terrace for a nice steak dinner. Shout out to the staff - Fai, Abigail, Riski & Derin!"

Always my got to hotel whenever I go to Jakarta.||The room is always cold, clean & comfy to stay with.||The staff is nice and helpful, especially Dindha at the check in counter👍🏻||The breakfast is also good, maybe even the best compare to other mercure in jakarta."

Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,masjoandyoh,5.0,"The location of the hotel was perfect for me which it was situated on heart of the city.. The check-in process was also smooth and efficient by reception staff. The hotel amenities were top-notch with high standard of cleanliness as well. Overall, my stay was an unforgettable experience and the staff's genuine hospitality makes me want return here again in the near future"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Kikita Yoshehana,5.0,"We got a very spacious room with great view, very nice interior both for the bedroom and bathroom. We really enjoy our stay here. And because we are Accor plus member, they gave us complimentary cakes and we enjoyed our welcome drink in the cafe with nice ambience. The service is also good. The location is strategic in the middle of Jakarta. Overall it’s a nice experience 😊

The only downside is the water in the swimming pool was very cold, and it’s so windy there, we cancelled our swimming plan because of that."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,M Ammar Fadhlur Rahman,4.0,"Being a regular at this hotel has only deepened my appreciation for the consistently exceptional experience it offers. From the warm welcome at the entrance to the comfortable and well-appointed rooms, the attention to detail is evident throughout. And I must commend Adzra, one of the remarkable staff member in the restaurant area. Each visit reaffirms my choice, and I can confidently recommend Mercure to anyone seeking a reliable and enjoyable stay."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Have often stayed here. The rooms are clean, room requests are fulfilled, the staff is friendly, the food is delicious, only the breakfast is really full in the morning. Sometimes there is a little leftover food that can't be refilled. The egg station waited until 15 minutes before the eggs were ready. Maybe it was so busy at breakfast. Thank you Mercure Gatsu"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Chaterin Leao,5.0,"Perfect ! Can see them suffering from above in those traffic while I’m enjoying the pool, and the gym 😂😂. Nice view , comfy bed , had massage lady came to my hotel was the best decision as well, service was good ! Just the front office guys were very cold . But the security, and other staff are friendly! The location is okay , very traffic location to reach hotel when it’s traffic peak! Compare other hotel that’s all!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Trip.com Member,4.0,Very good. Highly recommended. Friendly staff. There is a subway nearby. Breakfast is ok. The scenery is nice. The whole experience is cost-effective. The price is very favorable. Highly recommended. You can give it a try. It’s nice to stay.
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,safia hares,5.0,"Lana, was very helpful and understanding. The cafe has been just what I needed after very long flight to relax and have some amazing drinks and food. Best customer service. Highly recommend. Staff are always happy to help you. Will be coming back again."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Bobby William,5.0,"Almost everything about this hotel is great. Room is very spacious, the bathroom is clean and shower pressure is great. The Gym is probably one of the best hotel gym for this budget. It has a squat rack with barbell and bumper plates, heavy dumbbell options, multiple treadmills and calisthenic bar for dips. There are some things that could be improved like, the wifi signal (i stayed at the 28th floor) could’ve been better, breakfast was bland and the chicken is really dry. Egg cooking station waiting time is really long. But other than that i still give this place a full 5 stars rating because of the gym. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Alfathania Syakura,5.0,"The room was amazing!!! We got an executive suite and the view was great! I had such a good night sleep there! We had breakfast in the hotel too! Mira was so nice! The milk was empty so I asked her if she can refill the milk and she personally send a glass of milk to my table. Besides, she could speak english so it’s easier for us to communicate what we want. Altho food quality still need a lot of improvement, I still enjoyed my breakfast here because of the service :)"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Anggito Arifin,5.0,"What an unexpected and enjoyable breakfast experience. I underestimated the taste of each dish but yeaa I was wrong, it was delicious. One of my fav dishes is chicken noodles. It has a good chili sauce. Special thanks goes to Mba Mira. I greatly appreciate your help💯

This is the view outside. I hope this makes your day🥰"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Yanee W,5.0,"Enjoyed our 2 nights at the Executive Suite. Room is very spacious, clean and adequate. I love how the room has full length mirror everywhere.
Breakfast spread is only ok. Food quality needs improvement. Service is good, no complaint. Thank you to Mira for taking care of us during breakfast."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Gio Aguste,5.0,"I had a wonderful stay at Kemang Icon Jakarta. The suite I stayed in called Ionic suite, it was not only spacious but also uniquely decorated with a classic touch, giving it a charming ambiance.

The staff, while not numerous, were incredibly friendly and attentive. They made sure I had a comfortable and enjoyable experience throughout my stay.

While the breakfast was served à la carte rather than buffet-style, the food was absolutely delicious and satisfying.

Overall, Kemang Icon Jakarta impressed me with its spacious and charming suite, attentive staff, and delectable breakfast. It's definitely a hotel that maintains a high level of performance. Please keep the performance."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Andrew B,4.0,"First comment: Be cautious lately about any reviews of Jakarta Hotels. From my feeling most of them are fake and asked for by the reception staff. It is easy to spot as most write exactly the same content. ||The hotel is located more to the South of Jakarta. ||Check in at the hotel was pleasant and hassle free. ||The only issue was that the pictures on the forums looked different to the room I got. ||The hotel staff was very helpful to accommodate me. After viewing other rooms I stayed at that initial room. ||While it might not be the real 5* hotel, however, housekeeping is very prompt and any issues are addressed very expeditiously also. ||If you take the option with breakfast, it is just a Western or Indonesian option, but not buffet style but food is sufficient for breakfast. ||During my stay pool was closed for a function on one day as the hotel roof seems to be a favourite spot for parties, but actually, the pool is quite small, so not of any much distraction anyway. ||The place has a bar at the roof also, alcoholic drinks are at just 7.50 USD (affordable). ||Cons: |- TV screen is quite small compared to the room space. also cannot be watched at the seating area. |- Bathroom has an totally open concept|- Certain housekeeping items have to be ordered by phone|- Not all Towels are on 5* level| - Water kettle should be replaced by non plastic type|- Front rooms nearer to the main street may be noisier from traffic and bars||Pros: |- Room design is different in every room and packed with arts and accessoires |- Rooms are spacious |- Bed was comfy fitted with one thinner and one harder pillow|- Room make up is excellent and place really cleaned up. |- Wifi worked for me, each rooms have an own wifi spot|- The room has some sound speakers to listen to music or for tv|- Rooms are fitted with two aircons, which you can control temperate just like at home. ||You don't get the branded 5* night rates but still the rooms and service level are on an upper level. ||While people complained in earlier reviews that there is only one lift, but the hotel just has about 20 rooms on 2 floors, so for me it wasn't an issue. ||I would though recommend the hotel to close the bathroom with some nice wooden wall and just leave a small part open. ||Nearby the hotel are many fancy restaurants and bars, one shopping mall (Lippo Mall) is around 800m away (with a Hypermarket).  Pagi Sore (Nasi Padang) and Sawaregmoe Resto (inside at Kemang 10 ""mall"")  has good Indonesian fare. There are many fancy coffee places for coffee lovers... and many more restaurants from $ to $$$ also in the area.||Overall, on a working trip, I had a pleasant enjoyable stay at the hotel. But note that the area is much in the South of Jakarta, so for first time tourists or Jakarta sightseeing interests the Kemang Icon might not be the most suitable location.  If you need huge shopping malls with fancy brand stores around you, then it wouldn't be suitable also. |"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Agus Suci Wulandari,5.0,"Love this Hotel, located in a very strategic un Kemang, you can find a lot of places for eat, leisure, and coffee (of course!)
The room is spacious enough, elegant interior,  instagramable roof top, staff are friendly. Rate of this hotel is affordable for a 4 star hotel, overall a nice experience when staying in this hotel."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Firza Destrian,5.0,"What a lovely boutique hotel in Kemang area.
Nice aesthetically decorated building with artistic touch of each suites.
Fabulous service particularly Mas Erick. Will come back soon"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Stay40701668883,4.0,"Was here with 6 colleagues, was fine. Felt like it must have been amazing 20 years ago.  A bit older now, especially the rooms. There are a total of 12 rooms, so if there is anything you don’t like just ask to change (some rooms have open showers).  Rooms were nice though.  Breakfast was fine, blu cheese burger for dinner was amazing.  We had meetings in south Jakarta so it was convenient for us.  There are a lot of restaurants nearby, which is nice. Enjoyed breakfast outside on the rooftop in the mornings."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,angela d,5.0,"Very nice hotel, fabulous decor. Helpful staff, great views from the rooftop. We spent 3 nights here, we would come back. The room we stayed in was huge, it had an office and a fridge freezer! Everything was clean and comfy. We had everything we needed."

Kemang Icon Jakarta,Abbott Hsu,5.0,"A very well organized and delicate hotel in Kemang area. You can feel how the owner wants to create the modern and traditional atmosphere by having mixed decoration inside.
The staff are really friendly to serve you no matter in room service or at it's bistro. Though there are 12 rooms here, the overall maintenance and service are super good. A good place to stay on weekends or holidays at Kemang. Enjoy it."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Hendy Hendrawan M,5.0,"Nice, unique place... Perfect for family staycation."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Kris Trimoeljo,3.0,"I booked this hotel tempted by the photos, room size and price.
While the room is big , I think the maintenance has not been paid good attention. You can take a look at the pictures.
With abundance of choice at around similar price level, I may not return back here"

Kemang Icon Jakarta,Lestari Astriani,5.0,"Unique place, nice room ambience, good food, very recomended"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Gee H,4.0,"It's been some time that I visited this establishment.||What used to me Alila run and owned, has been now become locally run and owned.||Prior to check in, the staff said: we are now independent, kindly forgive us in advance to any shortage of delivery that you may experience.||Now, that statement makes me wonder or worry how bad can they be now that is independently owned. But thankfully, it was not all that bad but, there are areas which can be improved.||The main road is right now underway of expansion so there are works going on, in Agoda, it was not indicated so honesty should be kept because I would still have stayed at the premise regardless.||The location is at the T junction of Kemang Raya. Brace yourself for insane traffic during nights, it's a busy area so do take note. But it's littered with trendy cafes and eateries in the vicinity.||Rooms - what I had was the Ivory. But as there are only 12 rooms in the whole establishment, it'll be nice that we can get to see the rooms as it is not labelled as: courtyard suites generically. There were so many images that indicated Courtyard Suites and some of the images showed a bigger and better room which I thought I paid for. ||Clean and big room made me happy but the size of the TV was sorry to say, A JOKE. Granted that a guest here should not focus on watching the TV rather than enjoying the facilities and also location environment but to provide a HUGE room with a 24"" TV was just ridiculous!||The design of the room plugs were also odd with all power plugs being used for lights the such. Ironic how I had to use a light dedicated plug for the kettle because the coffee area had NO plugs.||The room was encased in external glass but as it's literally a handshake away from the next building, security can be compromised. How about adding another layer of dead glass to current glass layer that can be opened? Apply 2 way glass treatment on that for privacy. Also, this will reduce noise pollution from neighborhood and also the main Street.||Room amenities were quite bare. Yes there were water and coffee facilities but the shower gel were not topped up. The towels were cream looking ( not that it's that colour but white has turned into pale and tired cream!) The room slippers were similar of that in POP hotel. ||In a nutshell - where is the opulance?! It's a boutique hotel. The room was nothing but not. Slapping a nice rug and white everything hardly justifies it as such.||Decor - it was quite interesting but many spaces were oddly left alone to its own devices. It's like a white elephant. What a waste of perfectly fine space! It could be made more interesting - this I leave to the management employees.||Food - the rooftop was beautiful. At night it was great. And in the day, it's inviting. So we had dinner and bfast there and I have no complaints on the quality and standards of food. ||Staff - all friendly and helpful, I have no complaints as well.||Overall, it's sad to see an icon as such being undertaken locally but not allowed to fully show it's potential. ||My comments, I feel, should they be met, will surely put Icon up to its previous glory again. 4/5 stars due to my comments above but otherwise, it could have been a 5star experience from me. ||"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Mohd Nafzahizam Mohd Adnan,5.0,My 2nd time here. Love the room and the services. All staffs were really helpful. Great location as well!
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Josh Patil,1.0,"The worst hotel I’ve ever been too. Staff don’t care at all to help. Empty promises. Woke up to my room completely flooded in water the first morning. WiFi hasn’t worked for 2 days. Construction FROM the hotel starts at 7am and drills into the rooms from outside.

They have ZERO thought of customer service. A 1 star hotel under the disguise of a 4.

What a rip off."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Santino Pasini,1.0,"Kemang Icon by Alila was one of our favourite hotels and I have stayed here many times years ago. Today is my first visit here again after maybe 4 or 5 years. I was very excited for the great experience again. Then, we are shocked to see what we see today.

First of all, the furniture and the fixtures inside the room are not in good condition anymore. We can understand that for a hotel that is more than 10 years old. But what really upsets us is the broken elevator on our second day which has forced us to walk up the stairs to our room on the 3rd floor. I can handle this ‘exercise’ but we have our 75 years old mother with us and it is very hard for her to do that. What frustrating is the problem cannot be fixed promptly by the hotel. And there is no duty manager available on the premises!

Unfortunately the bad experience does not stop there. When we had our dinner at the edge restaurant, our tenderloin steak and rib eye steak were very dry and hard. It was far from juicy and soft meat that I remember when I ate here years ago. This time it really taste like a frozen meat that has been kept for days and not cooked properly at all.

I am very disappointed because I really liked this hotel before. Apparently, the hotel is not part of Alila anymore. Is this the reason of such a downgrade in quality? Current management of the hotel MUST do things right urgently if they still want to exist"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,chrissy djafar,5.0,"Back to this place for the African food, the best !"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Erika HDRF,5.0,The vibe and the view was just perfect. We caught the sun as it was setting and the night lights were stunning. We got the advantage of using the upper room and the decor was wow. Great spots for a photo shoot. Oh and i suggest this place for private parties. Great place
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Omri Ben-Canaan,5.0,"Kemang Icon is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in in Jakarta.
Rooms are huge: 85sqm - Staff is super friendly and helpful and location is ideal, very central.
Restaurant is delicious with a lot of different cuisines so no need to venture outside or gojek anything.
There is a beautiful pool on the rooftop too.
Will definitely come back.
5 stars hands down."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,deetje d,5.0,"Myself and my husband celebrated Valentines Day and stayed at the hotel.The rooms are very large and all unique in interior design and decoration. We were made very welcome by all the staff but looked superbly by the General Manager, Mr Stanley.  ||We had a lovely Valentine Dinner in the evening and a good range of food was available for breakfast.||Would fully recommend this hotel and hope to be back soon."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Remko Simons,4.0,"Small hotel (only 12 rooms), large hotel rooms, a little bit old but still have nice design. Bathroom open space without door"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Dewi Wulandari,5.0,"I always have a special room in my heart for small hotels like this one. It only has 12 rooms BUT each room was uniquely designed, so each one is different. I stayed at illusion room, which was very spacious. It needs a bit of TLC on the interior but I heard it is scheduled for renovation. Mas Ilham the manager was very helpfull. Breakfast, wasn't buffet but you get to order from a list  that is all looked very delicious. I stayed here alone to get some me time and it's worth every dime. I got the sense of space and quietness that I dearly needed. And I already scheduled to come again on new year with my family. Conclusion? You should definitely put this hotel in your list"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Saiful Bakri,5.0,Hotel is a bit run down. Still quite charming. Location is decent.
Kemang Icon Jakarta,efrikson nadeak,5.0,"Always Best experience To visit this hotel and  Restaurant,  I always  Happy, comfort And enjoy In here, recommended To try this hotep and restaurant"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,muhamad A,5.0,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel, the rooms are nice and luxurious but classic impression, the employees are all good, when we checked in everything was informed to us by a staff named Nixon he is a good person and very friendly, for breakfast we were served well and the food was delicious if I'm not mistaken his name is chef Rudy and what amazed me he asked How did the food taste and I said it was delicious, we also had time to talk with chef Fahmy he served us very well, thank you for all the good service and food Super delicious ..., thank you to all the staff who served us, keep it up, keep up the good work Kemang icon"
Sutasoma Hotel,Lim CY,4.0,"Varies choice of local cuisine in the breakfast buffet. Coffee table arrays are sofas mostly. However if you prefer proper table and chairs to dine in, the choice is there as well.

Ms Linda had great personality and we talked about surroundings nearby the hotel. Mr Welly make great coffee to my preference."
Sutasoma Hotel,Philina Lauw,5.0,"I totally enjoyed my stay here because all the staff were so helpful. They even allowed me to have early check in because I have no where else to go. What I love most was the serenity, the peaceful environmeng. Such a great hotel."
Sutasoma Hotel,Mary Anne Luis,5.0,"Hotel staff are very friendly, attentive, and always ready to help; hotel rooms are very clean, and facilities are in excellent condition; food is also good. Many many thanks to Nadia and the GM for aways going the extra mile and making my stay quite memorable! Will definitely recommend this hotel to others."
Sutasoma Hotel,James Smith,5.0,"Five (5) stars are not enough for me to rate this hotel as the comfort and service provided far surpassed my expectations and  went far beyond any previous hotel stays I have experienced, and I have travelled internationally quite a lot over the past 25 years.  I came here on a two-week business trip and I decided I didn't want to stay at one of the chain hotels but rather I wanted to stay at a boutique hotel that had more of a local flavour.  I decided on the Sutasoma hotel due to the excellent reviews and its proximity to the places I needed to go.  I decided to book only for a few days at the Sutasoma Hotel and then would decide whether or not I would stay longer.  After experiencing excellent comfort and outstanding service, how could I possibly leave?  So I stayed for the entire 2 weeks which turned into 3 weeks as there were delays in the project I was working on.  During my stay, each and every one of the staff went well out of their way to accommodate this ""bule.""  While everyone was so friendly and helpful in every respect, there are a few people that really stood out and went the extra mile to accommodate me namely:  Linda, Lexi, Basri & Welly (I may have spelled one or more of these names wrong).  I had mentioned earlier during my stay that my Singaporian friend back in New York insisted that I bring back a Lappis Legit cake.  On my final day, Linda surprised me with a beautifully wrapped large Lappis Legit cake.  I was overcome with emotion and gratitude that Linda would go well out of her way for this bule.  Lexi, Linda and Bisra and others were so respectful to my driver and make him feel so welcome.  I must also mention how comfortable my room was, each and every day and while all the cleaners were very, very good, I must make special mention of Badri.  Each day, after a long work-day, it was so nice to come ""home"" to a freshly made bed, turned down with my slippers alongside the bed.  Usually a nice pasty was next to my bed and on some days fresh fruit delivered to my room.  Fresh towels were always provided, bathroom items replenished, plenty of water provided as well as the packets of coffee, tea and condiments.  I am writing this on my final day, only to learn a couple of hours ago that my flight has been rescheduled to the following day.  I am looking on the bright side; I get to stay another day in my ""home away from home with my new friends."""
Sutasoma Hotel,Inaya Y,5.0,"Came back here to stay for 3 days and 2 nights in room #520. Stayed during the Chinese New Year long weekend 👍🏻 (9-11th of Feb). We came back because I was craving the Mashed Potatoes we like so much and the scent of the Hotel ✨🫶🏻 turned out my very first breakfast on the 10th of Feb has no Mashed Potatoes menu in it lol 😄 We decided to ask the Atman Lounge staff which they explained that the everyday breakfast menu has changes with everyday rotation, Mashed Potatoes were served on Tuesday/Wednesday. We were sad but Atman Lounge breakfast has never failed us (with or without the mashed potatoes😆) we were approached by one of the staff Mba Linda and she asked how was the breakfast and we told her that we miss your mashed potatoes and she said she will look out for the next upcoming mashed potatoes menu that will be served during breakfast. ||During our second breakfast on the 11th of Feb, surprisingly the breakfast menu has Mashed Potatoes served Alhamdulilah. We were so happy and shocked we thought it’ll be serve on Tuesday/Wednesday 😄😄 (this was on Sunday) Mba Linda came to approached us and told that she managed to tell the chef to serve the menu with Mashed Potatoes. Thank you so much we were so grateful for the services and hospitality. Highly respect Mba Linda and the Chef for doing it for us 🤍🤍🤍 ||While checking out, Mas Welly helped us taking some pictures in the Lounge. Mas Welly and Mba Linda gave us another compliment with a free Chocolate Mousse for me snacking 🥰 thankiyu so muchhhh. Me and my Husband will definitely be back soon, just very soon🥰🫶🏻👍🏻👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Sutasoma has the best services and hospitality no doubt 🤟🏻✨👌🏻"

Sutasoma Hotel,Yasmin Inaya,5.0,"Stayed here for 1 night in room #522 on 13th-14th of January. It was an unforgettable experience for me & my husband! My cousin had her wedding night next to this Hotel in Tribrata (a walking distance from the Hotel) which made me booked this Hotel. The room is not too spacious however it was VERY CLEAN and smells so good. We received a baby-moon complimentary services which have made me and my husband so happy 🥰🫶🏻✨the front desk staff was very helpful as well as the bellboy (Mas Rossi) The food was our favorite thing! Had some of Tribrata’s food during the wedding night and the next morning, we had breakfast at the Atman Lounge and surprisingly the food quality was superb and SUPER DELICIOUS. We had a lot of options 👍🏻👍🏻 stayed for 2 hours just for our breakfast, MasyaAllah. Thank you for the Front Office & Housekeeping team that has decorated our room beautifully. We are very sure we’re going to be back before our baby labour.

PS;
We’re in love with Kue Lapis evening snacks and Keripik Nangka 😍😍😍
And the Mashed Potatoes on breakfast was AMAZING ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ would love to be back just to have breakfast again at Atman Lounge."
Sutasoma Hotel,Diana Pratama,5.0,"Had a pleasant stay here ❤️

Stay at Kakawin Suite for 3D2N so spacious and comfortable. The bed, sofa, bathroom are clean, all staff are helpful and nice. Breakfast at Atman Lounge i really enjoy because i love indonesian food and traditional cake available there. I love strolling around here, the view with aesthetic classic architecture. And for dinner at elisse was amazing food and mocktails too 😘👌🏻

Absolutely will come back here very soon ❤️🥰"
Sutasoma Hotel,Shaina Gandanegara,5.0,"I had a delightful stay at Sutasoma Hotel. The place is exceptionally beautiful, and the staff members were incredibly accommodating. While the hotel might not be as expansive as it appears from the front, it still provided an enjoyable experience. The spacious beds and perfectly sized rooms made for a comfortable and cozy stay. I would definitely recommend it!

One added perk was the hotel's proximity to numerous Korean cuisine options, making dining choices both convenient and enjoyable during my stay."
Sutasoma Hotel,Diah Ika,5.0,"Don’t hesitate to book this hotel it’s really the paradise with people always want you to feel home like Rico, Linda, Fuzan, Sofia and a perfect cuisine with a changing menu everyday made by a kind Chef. Would recommend 10000%"
Sutasoma Hotel,Bima Rantautama,5.0,"Hotel is near with city center. It's very close with MRT access so its quite easy to ger arround. Room is perfect, food is yummy and service is marvelous.

Thanks for Ms. Willa for arranging wonderful weekend for me and family."
Sutasoma Hotel,Cahyadi P,5.0,Had my first meeting experience at Gala Rooftop at Sutasoma. The room is spacious with interesting concept of separate coffee break and lunch buffet area. So that participants move and walk around to get the food and beverage. It is good to refresh after sitting for a while. There is also an open space (outdoor) which will be great for barbeque or outdoor activities. The server is consistently friendly and helpful : Ari. Thank you so much
Sutasoma Hotel,Kanitta Tongdaeng,5.0,This's my first time to visit this country such a good memory I got by this hotel crews. Thank you Linda for your smile every morning when I went to have breakfast and hope to see you in Bangkok!!!

Would recommend this hotel to anyone who need to stay in the south. Would definitely come back next time :)"
Sutasoma Hotel,Isabella A,5.0,"The room is spacious and comfy. All the staff are always helpful and friendly, the room service is just a one call away and will come immediately. There are various complimentary snacks and refillable mineral water. The provided amenities are sterile and useful. I really enjoyed the stay in here!"
Sutasoma Hotel,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Facilities: The swimming pool is super comfortable and cleanService: Very friendlyEnvironment: Very high-end, very quiet, suitable for business families, etc.Health: very goodIt's a very nice hotel. I will go there again next time.Breakfast is rich"
Sutasoma Hotel,Renz Calub,5.0,Sutasoma Hotel has been our first home when we made our big move to Jakarta from the Philippines. We enjoyed our stay. The rooms are nice and spacious. The breakfast buffet is good and unforgettable because of the Indomie station! We hope to return to Sutasoma for a staycation or brunch soon!
Sutasoma Hotel,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Nice design and basic room. Nothing much around the vicinity of the hotel even though it is in Dharmawangsa . . unfortunately the wrong side!So if you are looking for cafes, bars, eateries around the hotel better not stay here. This hotel is attached to a convention hall which I believe is popular for weddings. So could be crowded and noisy if there is a wedding or event going on. Breakfast was pretty good and affordable. Service overall is very good . . all the staff try to make the guests happy.The cafe food is ok if you stick to the standard Indonesian cuisine. We tried the Tom Yam Goong Soup and it was totally not right! But in all fairness the F&B manager did not charge us for it after we gave him the feedback.Will probably stay again if we have meetings that way."
Sutasoma Hotel,Johanes S,4.0,"Service was good, hotel staffs are very friendly. Food is excellent for its price point. Well-maintained and hoping it would stay that way. ||Would give this hotel a full mark if they improve their poor soundproofing, would not recommend this hotel for light sleepers like myself as you’ll be woken up by noises from your neighbors, even a normal conversation could be heard."
Sutasoma Hotel,Mile R,3.0,"The hotel is conveniently located to the mall where restaurants, super market and drug store are there.
It’s a pity because……..:
The bathroom lacks Towel Rack, Hooks, Drawers.
When we entered, toilet seat was dirty, the washbasin water didn’t run smoothly.
Towels were greyish looking.
There was cockroache in the bathroom.
At the coffee shop, the rice was hard, it looked like the cheff was using old rice to make fright rice.
Room temperature was freezing, we couldn’t adjust it to lower."
Sutasoma Hotel,Padmasita Kumoro,5.0,Breakfast was great. Mba Linda - Mas Welly from Atman were very friendly and helpful. Thank you.
Sutasoma Hotel,Charmaine Yong,4.0,"Convenient location with cafes and restaurants nearby (skewed towards Korean and Japanese restaurants). Bed is very comfy and the room is very clean, the only issue was waiting for the iron and ironing board that took an hour to be sent to my room.  Had to call the reception 3 times but other than that, a very pleasant stay."
Sutasoma Hotel,Jarupath Jitdoungprem (LordGift),5.0,"Very nice place and good service.

Breakfast lounge has many foods for foreigner. They can try Indonesian food or choose  their familiar.

Central heating may have some problem because it too slow to warm water.

The wall may be too thin because I can hear voices from  another room."
Sutasoma Hotel,Vidi,5.0,"Amazing stay, very unexpected! Every decoration and details (like the air freshener) was so pretty and traditionally elegant. Everything that's metal are gold-colored, adding to the elegant ambience. Great AC, in-room dining and room layout. Exceptional receptionists who keep on helping me for stuffs like printing my boarding pass and other small errands. The only minus were the shower that sounds a lot sometimes when it's not being used, and the other guests. Was unfortunate enough to be in the same floor as so many kids and family traveler who were very loud, ringing the doorbell a lot of time, and running around the corridor the whole time. Even ringing on my doorbell once as a mistake. But otherwise a great hotel!"
Sutasoma Hotel,Kk Dede,5.0,"Amazing servicee! We had breakfast on our weekday, and greets by Mba Linda, and Mas Bisri, they offered us an omelette and a cup of coffee/tea, and they are very kindfull of act of service. Thank you so much"
Sutasoma Hotel,Jsnsmbw,5.0,"I was coming for having breakfast at Atman Lounge, and surprisingly they could accept outsider guest to enjoy the breakfast as well. A very warm welcome from the front desk Mas Adi, and he escorted me to restaurant and showing the room. During breakfast i was assisted by Mas Bisri and he was very kind and helpful.||||At the moment Mas Adi came to my table and ask for further assistance, then i asked for room showing if possible and he assist me accordingly with informative detail explained.||I was thrilled by his exceptional hospitality. Thank you!"
Sutasoma Hotel,Mei Mei,4.0,"Nice hotel, smells really good. Room is clean and neat. Located in quiet street, very close to 2 korean supermarkets.

The room is not big but comfortable enough, with long seat by the window."
Goodrich Suites,Che Sheila,5.0,"I had an amazing stay here. My room was the Royal Suite, which had a bathtub with city view. They set up a crib for my baby so we could all sleep comfortably. The breakfast choices were great too. There were lots to choose from, and all of them were high-quality dishes, well presented and well prepared. However, their Nasi Uduk was to die for. That one item was the most memorable to me, compared to the other items in the buffet. Their Nasi Uduk was fragrant and well seasoned. The rich coconut aroma and spices really lingered in my mouth. It was very appetizing and left a pleasant aftertaste. It was so good on its own, but the side dishes are what made the meal complete. The staff was friendly and helpful. The interior of the whole hotel was luxurious but not overwhelming.

I will surely recommend this hotel."
Goodrich Suites,anastasia ratrih,4.0,"+ room is quite big, comfy, clean, smells sooo good💙
+ the hotel staffs are really nice & helpful
+ bathroom was great & clean
+ got upgraded room hehehe

- I got the towel at 5pm bcs of their vendor late to send them and the towel was smelly
- the water heater not really ""heat""
- aircon not really cold at the maximum
- breakfast was delicious, but less variety of foods
- no kids playground facility

4/5. will be back for sureee! worth it!"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,3.0,"When im check in the room is clean however i found House lizard dead in the room, tha hot water in the bathtub is not working also but the staff was quick for taking action. The room is quite noisy since the room is facing to front side."
Goodrich Suites,Vincent T,2.0,"Bad wifi signal, I had to use mobile data as it doesn't even reach the bed. A 3 rating hotel at best while somehow having a 5 star rating. While the hotel has decent rooms and exudes an air of luxury, it lacks the refinement that usually begins at 4 star hotels, mediocre food, poor use of digital media, lack of care for small details and the rooms do not accommodate for foreign travelers. There are often parties on Friday night in this area, so expect a bit of noise from outside and a lot of noise downstairs."
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,3.0,"There are cockroaches in the bathroom. But I like the service, my special request was fulfilled. It's just that things like food ordered outside have to be picked up in the basement, you can't ask for it to be brought."
Goodrich Suites,Aldila Ayuningtyas,5.0,"Some company held Iftar party but me and my son still allowed to go swimming in the pool, staff are friendly. We had really good experience, room also spacious"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,5.0,"A very satisfying experience. The hotel is clean, the service is attentive, the space is huge, and the feeling of the suite is truly unparalleled and exceeded expectations. The hotel was arranged on the side not facing the street, so it was protected from the roaring motorcycles in Jakarta. In the middle of the night, I discovered that there was a night light hanging on the closet that couldn't be turned off. I called customer service, and they took a ladder and a vise and snapped the wires off. The efficiency in solving the problem is worthy of praise. I'm more curious about how foreigners sleep with this lamp on. A very good hotel, clean and spacious. I will stay here again next time."
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Location:Everywhere in Jakarta is busy hence no matter the location it would be busy. From where the hotel is, with jam, its 1 hour to the airport. Cleanliness:The hotel is extremely clean. The bathroom is huge and luxurious. The bed and pillows are comfortable. The room size spacious and everything works well!Staff:There wasn’t much conversation nor request from us as we are easy travellers. But the receptionist was polite and kind during our check in/out. Not much issue."
Goodrich Suites,Andromeda Hayu Kurniawan,5.0,"Cozy place, strategic place, but somehow maybe at restourat at 3 floor need more fast time for serving food cause last time we order some food it's need atleast 45 minute for serving foods and drinks"

Goodrich Suites,Tania Federica,1.0,Mba marketing eventnya ga niat ladenin tamu & ga professional. Untung all team resto very helpful & ramah. Will not recommend this to all people who wanna arrange event here if she was still the marketing of this hotel.

Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,5.0,The hotel is very comfortable. The location is very good. It is close to the subway station. I am on a business trip. The staff at the front desk are also friendly. The room is clean and hygienic. It is very convenient to order food 24 hours a day.
Goodrich Suites,Neysa Nurannisa,5.0,"A really good experience at Goodrich. Spacious room, express checkin process, a reallyreally good breakfast with lots of choice."
Goodrich Suites,tsakila dania,4.0,"Cheapest and the most best value for money for 5 star hotel in jakarta! Breakfast was AMAZING and cheap. I would recommend this place! Amazing and unique interior design! Huge room with a bathtub! You have to notice something tho, there are a lot of illegal racing at night ( can be loud ), Small pool, a lot of dirty small details or scratched. And a pretty much small hotel for a 5 star. Staff was friendly and amazing tho! Well there are some minus and plus but I personally can tolerate the minus. But I would say its a 4 star hotel instead of 5. I would still recommend it because of the price, bath tub and breakfast!"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The room was good, clean and the place very strategic.We give 3 star for the facilities since the AC very hot until the engineer fixed it. The wifi also needed to fix, to make it more faster network, and very sorry since they dont provide the refrigerator (only coolbar)."
Goodrich Suites,Jojo S,3.0,"I am honestly disappointed with the service from workers at a 5 star class hotel in an elite area, namely in Kemang. Before I entered the hotel, I registered via WhatsApp asking for a baby bed for my toddler. Even when I arrived at the hotel, I reminded him again. I even called 2 or 3 times to ask why it hasn't been delivered yet. I even brought my stuff to my room myself because there was only one tool to carry customer's stuff to their room. Seriously for a 5 star hotel?? For the room and bathroom I was quite satisfied because it was big and quite clean. Then for breakfast, I eat at 09.45 in the morning which is they close at 10.30 but some of the food is empty and cold and then not refilled. In any hotel I stay, it's not even a 5-star hotel, even if the food runs out and closing time is still quite far, it's always refilled. Quite shocked. Then for the taste of the food apart from dessert, honestly quite disappointed again. Even on the table there is no tissue. My child accidentally spilled the infusion water then under the baby's chair was full of water and I asked some woman to clean it along with saying sorry for the trouble. The woman who guards the coffee machine idk the name with an unfriendly face just looks at it and nods her head. A man came long enough just to clean the floor. And indeed this woman is quite unfriendly to customers, yes, because there is no greeting whatsoever because when I entered the breakfast room I felt wow, it was really bad, there was no one guarding the front to ask what room it was from. Come in, just come in😅 even the workers there, if they run into a customer, don't say hello, just pass by. My suggestion it would be better if the workers were retrained for the sake of the continuity of this hotel itself, because my husband (a foreigner) gave an opinion that this hotel actually had to improve for many things because he had never found a 5 star hotel with service and breakfast  like this. Parking area is also very limited. Sorry but this is an honest review from me."
Goodrich Suites,Adi P,5.0,"I had a staycation with my wife and she was amazed by the interior and nuance of the room. The bed and the pillow was comfortable. Moreover, since my wife loves jacuzzi and there is a bathtub in the bathroom, it makes our staycation more complete.||Additionally, huge credits to the resto. The foods were nice and they served me well. Thanks to (sorry for mistyping) Mr. Faldy, Mr. Alfath, Mr. Azril and Mr Lutfi for welcoming and serving us friendly.||Once again, thanks for the hospitality and you did a good job Goodrich…"
Goodrich Suites,Prihadi Ramadhany,5.0,"3rd time stayed in this hotel, they have different room layout, my favorite room layout is room with number ending with 16 (e.g. 516, 416, etc.).  Toilet seat is heated and has many function buttons.

Location is at south Jakarta, where Kemang, Simatupang, Cipete, Fatmawati is nearby.

Its nice & quite hotel, except for Friday where its a

little bit crowded in parking area because people

coming for their restaurant & cafe on 8th floor. Room service f&b is good, tried gado-gado, oxtail soup and soto betawi.

Bfast selections its similar to most hotels, bread, pastry, fresh juice and western/indonesian food selections.

Checkin g checkout process is fast.

Will back for sure"
Goodrich Suites,Zaxman,4.0,Stay for one nite during Ramadan. The room was big enough but I wouldn't called it a suite. We didn't use the facility so I can't comment about it. Food during suhoor was the low point as the choice was less than adequate. Taste was so so but I give big point for the room.
Goodrich Suites,tika t,5.0,"Room is clean, spacious. The room vibe is comfortable. We bought room package with breakfast, the staffs were accommodating. Mas Sandi from the restaurant was very friendly, making sure we get good service. Good hospitality overall."
Goodrich Suites,Pavan KAPOOR,5.0,We attended a church event here last week and the function room was very a very good size for our group. The ambience of the hotel lobby is amazing too.
Goodrich Suites,Jeffry J,1.0,I have stayed here multiple times and this time i have a very bad experience. Lack of coordination between reception and breakfast room. I got tricked multiple times by the reception name Dela. So embarased and will never return to this hotel again
Goodrich Suites,cut emyra,4.0,"The hotel location very good near Kemang and near main road so easily accessible. The room also big and bath tub also available in certain type of room. Also available bar at the rooftop so you can easily hang out without go outside.

But, the services (in the restaurant) quite dissapointed and they need more train their waiter."
Goodrich Suites,Nugroho Ajie B,5.0,"Goodrich hotel is excellent. Located in the south area of Jakarta, near the Kemang, Cipete, Antasari, Blok M area.||The room is spacious and well furnished. Served on a cozy resto on the 3rd floor, the breakfast were tasty. The service was excellent, especially Mr. Fadil"
Goodrich Suites,Claire Bohrer,1.0,"Avoid at all costs! Never have I ever had such a miserable experience at a hotel (side note, this hotel is 3 star at best; the 5 star description is laughable).

Firstly, each night the hotel hosts events on the third and eight floor. Events with DJs and loud base and these hotel rooms are not sound proof. It doesn’t matter which floor you are on, the noise will carry and you will not get sleep until the event ends. Other issues include ratty towels with stains and bathrobes with holes large enough for your leg to fit through. The front desk attendants are also inattentive and won’t even give your room a call when you have a delivery. I cannot find a single nice thing to say."
Goodrich Suites,Adhika Mafran,4.0,"Affordable price for 5 star hotel.

Rooms :
Roadway noise, you can hear car's horn in the middle of the night. Like the room doesn't have soundproof.
The room has a sofa window and you can see others windows from here.

Buffet : Limited choice
Staff : Pleasant staff."
Goodrich Suites,Barried Gharizah,1.0,"Stayed in the Royal Suites Room. Room was decent however the layout was totally different from the advertised pictures. We booked the room because we wanted to enjoy the bath tub by the window but we didn’t get that. Understand that the availability is limited, but still disappointed. This wasn’t what we booked for.
Another issue was with the water. It was yellow/brown! Definitely don’t want to soak my body in that water. Complained and the staff just told us to keep draining the water until it is clear. We never had experienced this in any other hotel! They should clean their water tank/pipes!!
The room was also not soundproof. During the night, we kept hearing the music from the club downstairs and even from the nearby neighborhood event in the morning.
They offered compensation (free breakfast) but still it wasn’t an enjoyable stay."
Goodrich Suites,David A,5.0,"The taste of the food was Good|Servicing awesome, mr Faldy very friendly and helpfull. Staff in breakfast room friendly. The room was comfortable. The room clean adn tidy. Bathroom cool, facility good"

The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Jim D,5.0,"This is a fantastic hotel and a wonderful introduction to Indonesia.   We had a very comfortable pool overlook room for 4 nights and very much enjoyed returning each night to the hotel for a swim and to our comfortable room.  ||The included breakfasts were a highlight - we particularly liked the wide range of food, particularly Indonesian food, available.  Further the  staff were happy to guide us on how the locals eat the food and how to mix the various tonics.  The staff were also happy to fill our drink bottles for our days exploring Jogja.  ||The hotel is well located - close to the airport rail station and there are banks with ATM machines close by."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Maja G,4.0,"We spent 2 nights there with our 2 boys (age 15 & 18).  The staff were brilliant, 10/10 for the service.  The beds were very comfortable too and we loved the views from the balcony over the pool.  The rooms were lovely and cool given the outside temperature too.  The hotel was centrally located and given that it was also Ramadan, we were surprised how quiet our rooms were.  What bliss after such a long flight from the UK.  The boys loved the gym and highly recommend it. All the hotel need to do is improve the food.  Breakfast was immense but it really focussed on high processed foods and sugar.  Offering less of a selection ""of everything"" and focussing on quality and not quantity might be a winning formula at the Phoenix."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Susan S,5.0,"Beautiful old hotel, with many special touches.  Our suite was lovely.  Big bathroom with tub & lovely amenities.Dining areas were grand…so many stations for food from all over the world.  |Lots of meal options.  A gorgeous pool.  Used the spa for massages."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Jan-Markus H,4.0,"If you like mix of colonial with Indonesian flavor, this is your hotel. The hotel is a bit rustic and old, thus beautiful decorating, rooms are okay but old fashioned. Hotel has nice pool area and ok gym. Also, spa with massage is there. |Breakfast buffet has nice selection but my disappointment was cold food even if I was one of the first at the breakfast. Hopefully they will better in this."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Md Aman,3.0,Heritage hotel located near the Yogyakarta Monument. Posts of antiques and artifacts on display all around the hotel giving it a colonial feel. The room was nice and cozy and loved the balcony with view of the pool. However the room was located at the far end  which required a long and maze like walk to get to the lobby and restaurant. Accessibility within the hotel could be improved. The buffet breakfast had a good mix of western and local cuisine. Staff were polite and friendly.
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Kwong L,5.0,"We stayed for 5 days at the Phoenix and were really impressed by all aspects of the hotel. It is centrally and conveniently located and excellent value for money.  Hotel staff at Reception and the Restaurant were exceptional in their warmth and welcome, and always helpful and attentive; they always have a friendly smile and nothing was too much. They even packed us breakfast for our early airport departure. The rooms are excellent - beautifully decorated, very comfortable and spacious (the Deluxe), clean and had everything one needs for a holiday stay.   The Phoenix is a heritage hotel - its decor beautiful and tasteful (not glitzy like other 4* or 5* hotels) which makes sitting in the lobby or reading room, or open-spaced restaurant very restful. The whole place felt very spacious, with long corridors and open courtyards. Breakfast has a wide and sumptuous spread of local Asian and Western choices, and a good selection of fruit and juices to start the day. The restaurant menu is very good and reasonably priced.  We were treated to a tour of the hotel, given a talk of its historical significance - the older, original part of interesting architectural value - and its pride in housing Soekarno's office when Yogya was briefly capital of Indonesia.  All in all, I recommend the Hotel Phoenix totally. Stay there if you are going to Yogya."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"This hotel is really beautiful, with history and atmosphere. Although the hardware is old, it is well maintained and the bath water is very large!The kids loved the pool and there were very few people.We stayed for two nights and the breakfast was very rich every day. There would be new dishes and they would not be completely repeated. It’s so nice to sit outside and have breakfast!"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Maja G.,4.0,"A great location, with comfortable beds.  The staff were brilliant, they exceeded our expectations. The only thing that really needs improving is the food.  There really is too much choice at breakfast and not not enough quality ingredients. It's as if the hotel is trying to cater for absolutely eventuality without doing it well enough.  Lots of processed food, sugar and not enough fresh, quality ingredients."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Aidah S,5.0,"We booked at Phoenix Hotel for 3 nights. |We arrived on 20 April 2024, checked in very late about 2am. Front desk was very helpful.|Our first night room, the room toilet's flush system was not very good so we requested for a change of room.  The hotel was very kind to accommodate the room change.|We were also very happy with the breakfast selection and the service staff Shendy was friendly and helpful.|We will definitely consider this hotel for our next trip."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Overall, the hotel's decoration looks high-grade and comfortable. The layout is beautiful and has a sense of history. It's worth staying. But the hot water kettle in the room is broken, and points will be deducted for small details. Also, it may be because the sound insulation is not very good. In the morning, the cleaning staff frequently opened and closed other rooms to clean and rest. I couldn't help but check out early. Could it be that the staff was in a bad mood and behaved rudely?"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Marior Kosovi,5.0,"Greetings!
A lovely Hotel !!
Great Team! Extra ordinary !

The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Jonathan W,5.0,Welcoming staff: They really couldn't do enough for us. And they enjoyed playing with our three-year-old. || Central location: Very quick to access the main sites. ||Generous breakfast: Great spread. And also a decent restaurant for lunch and dinner. ||Happy Times!
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,4.0,"There are different opinions on the Internet. The good ones are praised to the heavens, while the bad ones are called Internet celebrities. Personally, it feels good, a humanistic hotel. The facilities are definitely a bit old, but acceptable. Glass bottled water, environmentally friendly. The breakfast was very good, with rich dishes and a good dining environment. In addition, the location is okay, but it is still a bit far from the train station and requires a taxi."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"When booking the room in advance, I stated that it was a wedding anniversary, so the decoration was grand. Thank you for your thoughtfulness! The hotel has a strong Indonesian historical style, and there are many historical objects placed in the corridors, which make people feel nostalgic for the past and lament that time flies and life is short! The front desk staff are warm and friendly, always greeting you with a smile, making you feel at home; those friendly smiles when we meet during the trip are always unforgettable!"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Anne Wil Stegeman,5.0,"Our stay in The Phoenix Hotel was absolutely memorable. Everything was just perfect. Ghita and Shendy, we really appreciate how you made our 3 year old son feel at home being so far away from home (Holland). Great thank you"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,See fei,4.0,"Nice building and decoration with good service from the staffs. The rooms were a bit dated. The towels were clean but aged, time to change. The teapot in the room was weird. Other than that all is well."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Reiko K,5.0,"In any sorts aspect this was an excellent place to stay. All the staff were so friendly and helpful.

The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Awesome hotel. Classic and excellent hotel. From decoration to service, it is impeccable.I especially like the hotel's furniture. The service is also very good. It's also very close to the city center. It's very cheap to download the taxi app.Breakfast is also good, especially the swimming poolHotel waiters, every one of them is smiling"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Sharon Simpson,3.0,"Positives - Public spaces really nice full of antiques and very nice colonial vibe. Pool was lovely and surprisingly quite cool. Hotel was quiet given we were in the middle of the city which was a big bonus. The hotel is quite central and near various restaurants and malls. Good coffee shop round the corner. Room was nice but a bit dated. The rooms need spruced up for the price. We paid £100 per night for pool view and £160 for Exec room. For Indonesia this is very expensive and I would not say the hotel was 5* and our room certainly wasn’t worth the cost as it was small. I wouldnt pay the extra for an Exec room.  The hotel provided a robe and slippers which was a nice touch. The staff were friendly and tried to be helpful and they kindly made some pandan pancakes for us which we all loved. Breakfast was ok but we thought it would be better to focus on fewer options and higher quality.

Negatives - We booked this hotel for a meeting. The communications with the manager were very poor before arrival and just as bad when we arrived. Our Project Manager repeatedly asked to speak to the manager or for them to call but this didn’t happen. On day one we had to search for staff to ask questions etc. The service was not good. Although on future dates after complaining we did have a member of staff assigned to us. Bar was a bit drab we preferred sitting in the lounge area. The beer was very expensive - more than the very fancy Renaissance we stayed in Bali! Cleanliness of room was ok but not great and the patterned coverlet on our bed was really stained which didn’t give a good impression. The sofa and chairs were also stained and sofa had holes in it.  So all in all would I stay again. Probably not."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The staffs are friendly. The check-in and check-out process were simple and hassle-free. Room is cozy and comfortable. Hotel location is great, not very far from the famous shopping street. The breakfast was okay but the meals that we ordered for lunch were very salty and oily for us."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The first night we stayed in Indonesia was very nice. Sitting on the balcony, blowing the wind, chatting, and eating fruit, I instantly felt like I was on vacation. The room is not big, but some small decorations are quite nice. The hotel is quite large, with many wood carvings and porcelain displays, and a rich variety of plants. It is highly recommended."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Western-style historical building in the city center. Booking in advance is good value for money. I can extend my stay in the suite on New Year's Eve. It's so expensive. I was shocked when I turned on the bath water. I think the pipes need to be cleaned. Bottled water is in limited supply. The curtains fell down. It was all an adventure. The breakfast is rich, but it can’t be served when there are too many people. The pool view is worth staying."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Gill Westaway,4.0,"A beautiful hotel, full of charm, a true heritage hotel. and a superb buffet breakfast was included in the room rate. My only complaints were that fruit juices on the otherwise impeccable breakfast buffet would be so much nicer if made from fresh fruit. I also found it unnecessary  for staff to remove my swimming costume from where it was lying on my swimming towel outside my room with no indication to me as to where it had been taken. Little details that spoiled an otherwise perfect stay!"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Paula M,5.0,"It was a business trip but I was also accompanied by family. I have stayed at this wonderful hotel several times before. Not only is it a beautiful hotel, the staff are exceptional and the food is excellent. Make sure you get a room or suite with balcony overlooking the pool."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,laniaa Anjlii,5.0,"The hotel's design is unique, with a wide range of history in it. The service was also excellent, especially the receptionist . Room cleanliness is also excellent, plus a very strategic location. Close to tourist attractions and food centers"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Faisal Alsaleh,5.0,"My 3rd days @ The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - MGallery 😇
I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - MGallery and I must say, the experience was exceptional, largely thanks to the wonderful receptionist, Jejeeyy. She effortlessly took care of my reservation, ensuring I got a good rate, and even arranged transportation from the airport to the hotel. Her local knowledge was invaluable; she recommended the breathtaking Parangtritis sunset and the bustling Malioboro Street, enhancing my Jogja city exploration.

A special shoutout also goes to the head chef, Mr. Bayu. Every morning during breakfast, he went above and beyond to ensure we had a delightful dining experience, helping us select from a fantastic array of dishes.

The entire staff was incredibly friendly and always wore smiles, making me feel right at home. Thanks to everyone at The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta for making my stay memorable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Yogyakarta!
Thanks

I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - MGallery and was thoroughly impressed with the overall experience. The hotel exudes elegance and charm, seamlessly blending heritage and modernity. The rooms were luxurious, the amenities top-notch, and the ambiance truly captivating.

A highlight of my stay was the exceptional service provided by the bartending staff, Felin and Tri. Their friendly demeanor and infectious enthusiasm added a unique flair to the hotel experience. Not only were they attentive and professional, but they also went above and beyond to make guests feel welcome and entertained.

Felin and Tri's jovial nature made interactions feel more like catching up with old friends rather than typical hotel service. Their sense of humor and quick wit had us laughing and joking throughout our time at the bar. It was evident that they genuinely enjoyed their work and took pride in ensuring guests had a memorable experience.

One aspect that stood out was their genuine interest in engaging with guests. They always took the time to ask what we would like to drink, offering recommendations and engaging in delightful conversations. Their personalized approach and warm hospitality truly set them apart.

In conclusion, The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - MGallery exceeded my expectations in every aspect, and much of that credit goes to the outstanding service provided by Felin and Tri. Their commitment to excellence, combined with their friendly and jovial nature, made our stay truly unforgettable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Yogyakarta and looking for a luxurious and memorable experience."

The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Daniel Navarro Lorenzo,5.0,"""Staying at this hotel was an enchanting experience, thanks to its stunning architecture and attention to detail. The swimming pool, patios, reception, and hall areas were particularly impressive and transported you to another era. However, I couldn't help but notice that the rooms could use some renovation soon. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend this hotel for its unique charm and ambiance."""
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Yuliana Natsir,5.0,I can feel the sense of Jogja in the past in this beautiful hotel.

Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The location is really good, 10 minutes walk from the train station. It is the busiest area on Mario Street, next to a big shopping mall, but it is not noisy at all because the window faces the alley. The room is a standard domestic all-seasons hotel, clean and comfortable, and the staff can respond well to the needs of guests. The drinks and snacks in the refrigerator are free and are refreshed every day. The breakfast is quite rich, completely beyond the standard of a three-star hotel. There are all kinds of shops, convenience stores, and restaurants downstairs. Starbucks is across the street, and the price is only half of that in China. This time, because I go out early and come back late every day, I booked their place, which is more suitable for travelers who don't stay in hotel rooms for a long time."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,S W,4.0,"Good location, clean rooms, pleasant staff. Breakfast buffet has good quantity but food is low quality items. Almost no cheese, no oats or porridge, no yoghurt, coffee on one day was undrinkable, juices are mostly water with syrup.  You can live off it but it is not nice. Go to karta cafe next door for much better food and the Malio Gelato across the street is very good. But aside from food, all was good, staff was so polite and helpful!"

When we arrived around 1:00 PM, they rudely informed us that check-in was only possible after 3:00 PM. Their attitude left a negative impression.||2. High Price: Considering the issues we encountered, the hotel’s pricing felt unreasonably high.||3. Lack of Customer Service: The hotel manager should prioritize customer satisfaction and be willing to compromise. Unfortunately, this was not the case at Aveta Hotel Malioboro.||In summary I was going to stay 2 more nights but due to the poor treatment and subpar conditions, my companions and I decided to book elsewhere. I hope the hotel management takes steps to improve their service quality and guest experience."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Andree Boehme,5.0,"The Aveta Hotel which is located directly at the Malioboro street is a good choice for a nice stay. It has a little Coffee Bar in the ground floor. The reception is in the 8th floor where also the pool is. It has a nice flair and charm. The rooms are well furnished and clean. The Service is excellent, esp for Laundry and Room Service. The breakfast has a good variety of Food and Drinks. Due to the Hotel is located directly at the Malioboro street you can stroll along the road, which has many Bars, Shops and Restaurant. Also a big Mall is directly next to the Hotel, where you can buy things of Daily need. An Alfamart is also not far away for grocery. I just can suggest it! If i ever will come back i would stay here again, for sure."

Aveta Hotel Malioboro,rashidah hafiz,5.0,"We arrived the hotel around 10am and we had to leave our bags at the receptionist area and only allowed to check in at 3pm. But they did mention that they will Whatsapp us if our rooms were ready earlier and they did text me around 120pm  but we were at another mall to have our lunch and to get our toiletries.

The rooms we had were spacious and interconnecting rooms as per request. They gave us 2 access cards each. AC was very good. Good tv selection.
There's a kettle, 2 pairs of bedroom slippers. The minibar was not very cold. The toilet has a bidet and rainshower has good water pressure and good temperature to ur liking. They do provide iron and ironing board too.

The pool and reception is on the 7 or 8 floor. The alley to the hotel carpark is very narrow so most of the time we had to book Grab near Indomaret store near to the main road. Very convenient to shop around and the mall is right next to the hotel! Fyi, the main road at Malioboro street is closed between 6-9pm for horse rides, rickshaws and pedestrian to roam around.

The hotel is 10-15 mins away from Yogyakarta train station but the road outside the station is very rough and abit difficult to walk with heavy luggages. Once u reach the shops at Malioboro st, no issues to walk with the luggage."

The buffet breakfast here is the same almost every day, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not."

One thing you can't miss in the hotel is their breakfast 🥰 love the service and menu that changes everyday~

Overall, price is worthit to what they offer!
Will definitely come back here!
Left a piece of my heart here ❤️"
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,stephanie maharani,5.0,"Strategic hotel location close to Malioboro street, kraton and titik 0 km. Delicious food for breakfast. Spacious room for family. All good Grand Zuri Jogjakarta and staff."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,rustam bachtiar,5.0,"Had a wonderful stay here April 2024. The receptionist and all the stafs including the resto team during breakfast were very kind & helpful.
Hotel & room looks well maintained and clean."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Trip.com Member,4.0,"It’s more lively when going out. The hotel includes breakfast, and the breakfast is quite rich. Putting two beds together is suitable for family travel."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Bimo Bayuaji,2.0,Have book the hotel few weeks before for 2 rooms. We request connecting room but they give us opposite rooms. When we arrive at 3 PM they even havent start to clean our other rooms. The RECEPTION TEAM really show a passive and slow response on giving us update on when our room will be ready. Kudos to the front office manager that promise to clean the room in less than 15 minutes and deliver on tine. Grand Zuri need to understand their staffing capacity in high season as well as training their front office/reception how to handle complain.
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Dei Dei,5.0,"Happy to stay at this hotel. The hotel is clean, the room is bright (highly important for me). The location is near Malioboro street and Tugu Station. Happy to stay here."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Briantab Tab,1.0,"1. Bad checking experience, the male front desk doesnt seem to have been trained in service industry whatsoever, he keep changing my order non smoking to smoking, double bed to twin bed. Lucky the lady next to him take over and CAN get the room as per my order. Dont know what get into him

2. Room is smelly and need a refurnish

3. Can get my breakfast because it eas super full, the staff didnt event bothered to help me. She just stand and do nothing even after i nudge her several time

You can find better accomodation with the same price around"

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Abdul Hamid,5.0,"Alhamdulillah, it was a very pleasant experience for 2 days visiting the city of Yogya and staying at one of the best hotels close to Jalan Malioboro. The staff are friendly and the food menu is extensive and delicious. I won't forget it. If you travel by train, it only takes about 5 minutes from the hotel to Tugu Station. I chose the Grand Deluxe room which was clean and comfortable. I had a great time during my stay here. Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends."

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,柯學毅,3.0,"I stayed at your hotel in Yogyakarta for a few days. In fact, the waitress at breakfast was very polite and it was a good experience. However, I stayed there for three days. Only the shower gel was provided on the first day and then it was not replenished for the next two days. I didn’t know when to clean the room. Why haven't you added anything? This is a little suggestion I want to give you."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Fadhil Hentino,4.0,"+ strategic location

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Trip.com Member,4.0,Nice hotel with very friendly staff. The room little small and not too clean (sheets old and the toilet door which was glass one was little dirty. Also the shower curtain old) The room noisy as the street was very noisy Breakfast well. Staff very friendly and helpful. The value of money is ok

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Dolive Syandious,5.0,The rooms are really good and for the breakfast they have so many food to choose and also its delicious five star for mee
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,ana purna,4.0,"5 stars for the breakfast and the housekeeping staff. they did excellent job and were always polite. most of the staff were great.

the rooms were a different story. the Grand Deluxe room was a nightmare. more expensive than 2 other types of room, yet it smelled due to humidity, because it was on pool level. you were also treated to no view but the pool tank that came up to higher than eye level. it was like staying inside an ugly aquarium. people’s dirty wet clothes were laying just outside the window, no privacy whatsoever. the hotel website was not honest about the Grand Deluxe rooms, it doesn’t show the ugly sight outside the window.

we refused the horrifying Grand Deluxe room and were ready to walk away to other hotel, luckily the management upgraded us to an Executive room. it was not luxurious, but more spacious and had a view. the rooms in general are old, even the executive room had ants on the tables. my travel agent secured a room at Melia Purosani for us to move, but i decided to stay at the Grand Zuri to show appreciation for this kind gesture of giving us a free upgrade. we stayed there for one week.

all in all the hotel offers a pleasant stay, as long as you can stay away from a Grand Deluxe room."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,rara billaa,5.0,"it's good enough, friendly waiters and u'll never bored about their dish. such a comfy zone. thank you Miss Febi and team. love itt"
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,sella M,5.0,"What can I say besides excellent! warm welcome from all staff,
great location (walking distance to Tugu train station),
spacious room (I stayed at the superior with Merapi mountain as view),
quite complete amenities,
the breakfast foods is ok but the placemnt of the food island is to narrow with the tables and foyer, and quite difficult to access to the other side when crowded,
cool gym and swimming pool.

Overall had a wonderfull experience stayed here."

Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Coming back with me, my sister booked a hotel here too. He is also happy and really likes the hotel. We asked my sister to stay near my room but instead she put it in front of my room just right 😂. Everything we need is fulfilled here. Our holiday was very memorable in Malioboro. Thank you very much, sis and sir, for serving us patiently and kindly. See you again 🙏✨👍"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Jul R,1.0,"Dirty hotel room, underwear left behind the shower door which indicates housekeeping didn’t clean the room. They only send somebody from staff to remove items and didn’t bother to apologise or offer room to be cleaned again. For 4 star hotel you would expect to offer room change immediately as a minimum. Dirty bedding and dirty towels! Poor management of the service. Definitely training required for front staff to manage this kind of situation. No language barrier on this case as we speak Bhasa.
As mentioned in some other reviews super noisy train station next to the hotel so unless you don’t need to know exact schedule of passing trains DO NOT BOOK IT! You will not get a good sleep here, hotel is very basic and is  2* rather than what advertised."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.0,"This will be a very helpful review, I hope it helps you. This hotel has two shortcomings. The first is that it is very noisy, because there is a singing spot downstairs, and the speakers sing until late every day. This is not a problem with the hotel itself. The second point is very, very important, that the hotel has no heat. water. It is said that many hotels here are like this. There is no real hot water with high enough temperature. The so-called hot water is warm and a little cold. If you require hot water for bathing or washing your hair, be careful to avoid pitfalls. In terms of other conveniences, this hotel is pretty good."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Erik Nilsson,4.0,"Good location close to the train station. Which fitted us well. Rooms was okey, but it's extremely loud from the trains and prayers. The best part was the breakfast which was amazing, good selection of local food and drinks for a very good price"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.0,"It's a five-minute walk from the train station. It's surrounded by the central business district. The service is good. The front desk was unfamiliar with the business and made a little fuss. The room was basically at the level of a guest house and was quite noisy. I checked the room and found it unacceptable. I immediately booked another hotel. , four-day orders cannot be canceled long ago. It is a waste of time. 4.3 points is more objective. I give 4.2 points."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The hotel location is quite strategic. In the Malioboro area and close to the train station. The train noise was very clearly audible to KNR, quite disturbing. It's not difficult to find but eat. There are lots of hotels around and it's open until evening. Clean rooms, friendly waiters. Very comfortable hotel."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.0,"I enjoyed my stay in this hotel . This was my first time in Yogyakarta and as a solo female traveler I wanted to make sure safety is priority.The hotel is just minutes walk to the train station that takes you directly to airport and to hotel. Was a breeze going in and out. You have to book train ticket prior Incase it gets booked up. The room was adaquent, spacious and location plenty of restaurant around and coffee place. A min walk to main street. I felt very safe. Thanks"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.0,"There were no accommodations like this near Malioboro, so we immediately extended our stay for one more night... It was popular because there were a lot of locals and it was cheap and clean... If you don't like local food, it would be better to skip the breakfast."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,efendy Isa,4.0,Nice hotel. Near to everything food cafe shopping. Can check in anytime. Breakfast also good. Variety of indonesian drinks. Luv it
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Farah Amalia,5.0,"The room was okay, the service was amazing (the staff were friendly ), and the breakfast buffet was excellent. The location was great but the train horns were something else you needed bare 😅"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,5.0,All facilities such as Maglio Boro Street and the bus terminal and subway station are nearby.It's easy to move to other areas and you can easily go to Malioboro Street in the evening.
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,ladyrain12,2.0,"The hotel has a great location opposite train station which is very convenient if you take train to airport. We booked this hotel for that reason due to next morning we had morning flight and took train to airport at 4.20am. |The room very decent, hairdryer was only by request not provided in the room, no shampo and soap eventough the tubes are there but empty 😅|That time our room view was train station which very noisy from the sound of train and information made by the train staff🥲 lucky that time we were very very tired so we managed to sleep. But for those light sleeper better avoid the hotel. |the hotel only walking distance to malioboro st. The room was clean. |The staffs were not friendly during my stay."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Michael Muhammad,3.0,"The sink was clogged up, not good. Service was good. Overall, recommend."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,5.0,The location of the hotel is very affordable to Malioboro.... Recommended for children because it has a view of the station (you can see the trains)
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The facilities are relatively old, a bit like a guest house in the 1990s, but the room is very clean and the price is acceptable. The biggest problem is that it's next to the train station and it's so noisy that I basically can't sleep without wearing earplugs, but the hotel doesn't have them, so you need to bring them. Next to it is Mario Pineapple Street, which is very convenient for going out for a stroll. The entrance is a one-way street, so taking a taxi will be troublesome. Anyway, if you can just transfer to Yogyakarta and stay there, and you have two more days to play, I wouldn’t recommend it."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.0,"I want to stay here temporarily for one night. The restaurant here is not bad, but I didn't add breakfast because there are too many delicious foods here, and the attitude of the service staff is very good. It's just that some accidents happened in the shower gel in the toilet, which caused The shower gel couldn't be squeezed out, so we were given a new room immediately after responding to the counter. The service is really great! You can try it if you have a chance, but it is true that the sound insulation is not good. After all, it is next to the train station, but the scenery outside the window is so beautiful, you can see the volcano🤤"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Mark Schoen,1.0,"Extremely loud and they don’t even offer ear plugs. So silly!! It’s not like the train appeared. Also, the windows are single paned so it is constantly loud. Also, there is no drinking water refill station like most hotels. They want you to buy more tiny bottles of water. I would not recommend staying here"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Adi Yudistira,5.0,"Nice hotel room with best location. Really close to Tugu Train Station and many other tourist spot. Malioboro street is just steps away from the lobby.
We made a mistake regarding the bedding type upon booking which we chose twin-bed. The Reception (lady) quickly offered bedding switch to king bed and we really appreciate his action 🙏"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Dorothea Cindy,1.0,"Staying here for 2 night. Hotel staff's service was really good and fast check in.

Not recommended for people who hard to sleep. Noise from outside even music from across the street could clearly heard from room. Dirty towel and blanket. Bathroom design with separate toilet and shower, and open washtafel made the room humid and smelly. What was the designer think when he designed this hotel's layout. Very poor layout arrangements.

10PM now, and i started to regret my decision to stay here because of the loud music from outside. Sorry but I'd say that i wouldn't recommend nor stay in this hotel for the second time. Even though the service was really nice."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Hotel is in poor state of repair.  We asked for hairdryer, they provided a broken one that looks risky to use.  We complained and they provided a proper unit.The kettle provided in the room is also dangerous to use, you could get your hand burnt to hold the handle. The towers provided are obviously old and yellowish.The rooms are small but functional.The lobby smells due to poor sewage system.The plus point is the Service Staff, like most in Yogdakarta, they are very nice."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The hotel is about ten meters away from malioboro street, across the road is the railway station, the transportation is convenient, and it is also a hot spot for tourist attractions. It is also within walking distance to the Sultan Palace and Water Palace. The hotel facilities are okay, cost-effective, quiet, you can ask for accommodation not to face the train station."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Had requested a room max on the 2nd floor but apparently got a room on the 9th floor, told to wait until finally allowed to enter the room at 14.30 even though I brought a baby but couldn't hurry up"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,A.L.,3.0,"The location of this hotel is excellent, literally across the street from the main train station and just steps from Jl. Malioboro, the main commercial street of Yogyakarta. The staff are also quite friendly.

The room though was thoroughly mediocre. The chair was filthy and covered in stains. The window blinds were literally disintegrating as I used them. The air conditioning barely worked. It was set at 16C but was only outputting at 25C. The bed and bathroom facilities were fine though. There was a lot of noise from the corridor from other guests and the cleaning staff. I only stayed here for one night before going to a different hotel."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Erica NMC,5.0,It's nearby train station. Staff are friendly and helpful. Room service was good too. Didn't expect much from the room cleanliness. There's a stain here and there. Overall still good.
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.0,Good location. Near to train station yogya. Lots of shops and cafe . Room size just ok for 2 people. Nothing fancy. Breakfast also ok. Varieties and lots of food
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,GunBali,3.0,"Located on walking distance from Tugu Train station. It is ideal place to stay when arrive on train.   It is also very close to center of attraction Malioboro Street and Keraton.   The hotel is new (was not there on my last visit to Yogya).  The place is generally clean.||||Do not expect to have good view here.   When you're on elevator you can see untidy roof of neighbouring house.     We ask for some information from staff in reception about local attraction, to our surprise they can not give sufficient answer.  I guess the hotel need to familiarise their staff on what's happening around their hotel (where the cafe with good music, where is the busking area etc etc).||||There is spa flyer in the room, when we call for spa service, the staff said it only available after 18:00 hrs (we call at 16:00).     Then we decide to search for outside spa which then come to the hotel.   Later that evening the staff called and willing to give a promo for 10 minutes shoulder and back massage.    Then we found out that they have a mutual contract with outside spa and actually they can be called at any time (not necessarily wait for 18:00).     It is a simple 'laziness' from the staff to say it is available at 18:00.  She should had called their spa partner first before giving un-favourable answer.||||Should you stay in this hotel ?   YES, if the good points described above match your requirement.||NO, if you look for more  peaceful place, with warmer staff attitude."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,ontheroadagainva,3.0,"Great location!  The hotel is located across from the train station which actually has a number of simple eating places and a minimart. Malioboro walking street is only a block away. It is packed at night with locals and tourists out to see and be seen.  There is a mall on Malioboro street about 4 blocks away with a number of simple places to eat and a grocery store. Grab is always available and can take you anywhere in town for a few $US.  The room price was about $33 per night with breakfast included.||||Being across from the train station, the horns on the trains woke me up multiple times each night.  The bed was comfortable, the TV was good, the shower had decent pressure, but the toilet had a smell.  Towels and sheets were stained and showed their age.  The hotel will only give you one key, so if you have two or more independent persons staying here, room access would be a headache.  The is no mini-fridge.||||I saw no other non-indonesians except me staying here.  Front desk personnel spoke English but limited.||||Seating at breakfast was way too limited for the number eating, and several times when I went back for more I returned to find people seated at my table and unable to communicate because of language.  I just sat in any empty spot and continued eating which freaked them out although they pretended to not see me sitting there. || The restaurant staff spoke no English at all so ordering eggs or drinks was tough, and I did not get what was desired a lot.||||The lobby, elevators, and hallways were clean and modern.  I like this hotel and may stay here again based on the location and bed comfort, but will likely skip the breakfast and ask for better towels and sheets upon check-in.||||I will post a picture of the horribly stained chair in the room which I just covered with one of the stained towels."

The food at the hotel restaurant was delicious, offering a variety of fresh and flavorful dishes for breakfast and dinner.

Our room was comfortable and well-equipped with all necessary amenities, including toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, and a coffee/tea maker. The bed was clean and cozy, ensuring a restful sleep.

The highlight for our kids was the pool access. The pool had a safe and accessible ladder, allowing them to enjoy swimming without worry. They had a great time and always looked forward to going back.

Overall, staying at The 101 Yogyakarta Tugu was an unforgettable experience for our family. We highly recommend this hotel for its excellent service, tasty food, well-equipped rooms, and child-friendly facilities. Thank you, The 101 Yogyakarta Tugu, for a wonderful vacation!"
THE 1O1 Yogyakarta Tugu,Fajar A,4.0,"One of many delightful options to stay close to the Tugu Yogyakarta. It's close to interesting places like shops, restaurants, and cafes.

The room was nice and clean. The points of improvement is the fridge which was quite dirty and not cold at all. My room was connected by a closed door to my neighbour and i could hear him talking clearly. Other than that i really appreciated my stays.

The breakfast was really good and the hotel provided us a lot of variety of food.

The hotel is in the Tugu area very very close to Malioboro."
THE 1O1 Yogyakarta Tugu,indah nia,5.0,"one of the recommended hotels in Yogyakarta which is located very close to the Tugu. hotelnya bersih, breakfastnya banyak macam dan enak semua. the hotel staff is also friendly and helpfull. special thanks to Mbak Rani (the hotel staff) for the special dessert dan ngobrol2nya👍"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,H. Breux,5.0,"We loved our stay at Royal Malioboro by Aston. We stayed for 2 nights at the start of our honeymoon in Indonesia and were impression by the great service of the staff, especially the kind waiter that helps on the rooftop bar and speaks excellent  English.

The location next to the city’s main artery (Malioboro) and in front of Yogyakarta main station is super convenient, however it comes at a price: loud train noises day and night that the windows of our room did little to prevent. Small issue really but worth noting I’m case you are a light sleeper!

Amenities are great with lovely rooftop pool and brand new gym. Spa is also very good according to my wife who had a 90min massage there.

Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Yogyakarta looking for a luxury, comfortable hotel with all the amenities.

Thank you again!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Rowan H,5.0,"Stayed here for 4 nights on a recent visit to Yogyakarta with my wife.||Pros|- Location - it’s right in the heart of the action adjacent to Jalan Malioboro and Jalan Sosrowijayan which feature most of your restaurants and shopping. All easy walking distance. In addition it’s directly opposite the train station (Stasion Tugu). This means we were able to get the train directly from the airport to the hotel rather than getting a taxi (I believe it was about 20000IP each for train tickets). This is the cheapest and fastest method to get to the hotel. You can walk from the train station maybe 300m to the hotel. It’s the tallest building in Yogyakarta so you shouldn’t miss it. We also jumped on the train to go onwards to Surabaya so it offered a great onwards connection. |- Rooms - Rooms were air conditioned and clean with comfortable beds. |- Value - We paid about 70000IP a night although we came during a quiet period in Ramadan. I think this is actually considered quite expensive for Indonesian standards but given the high standards of the hotel I felt it was very reasonably priced. This hotel appeared to be the most upmarket in Yogyakarta.|- Staff were very friendly and greeted us warmly whenever we left or returned from a day outside. We found the bartender upstairs, Aldo to be particularly helpful and wanted to give him a shout out. |- Wifi worked well|- Had a rooftop pool which was kept clean and offered views over to gunung merapi on a clear day. |- Had a rooftop bar adjacent to the pool for beverages and food. This was helpful as being a Muslim territory alcohol can be tricky to acquire sometimes. |- The gym although modest had enough equipment to get a reasonable workout. Free weights up to 12kg and a well maintained combination machine plus a treadmill and bike.|- Filtered cold and hot water available in the corridors (you can’t drink water out of the tap here). ||Cons|- Although the location opposite the train station was convenient for onwards travel the station did run 24/7 and there was a bit of noise from the trains in the middle of the night. I think this could prove problematic if you’re a light sleeper. |We did have some minor issues with our bathroom - toilet leaking and a bad smell when the water wand was activated rather than the shower. We advised reception of this and they did fix it same day.||Overall we enjoyed our time here and would have no issues recommending it to others."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Putri HS,5.0,"Had a very nice time at the hotel. Very affordable, close by all essential stuff. Room is clean and quite spacious for the price. Good varieties of breakfast. Additional plus point for the cozy rooftop, special shout out to Mas Aldo, always lovely and cheerful. Will definitely come back."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Myesha Zara,5.0,"threw an event here and it was worth it, even it was worth every penny. i just love the services here, if i could rate it the score would be 100/10. also everyone here were so kind and polite. food was good, but couldve been better. overall so great to have Royal Malioboro by ASTON as the place to throw your event, you wont be disappointed!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Ezaruddin Abd Rahman,5.0,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was large with a very comfortable bed. Front desk were very accommodating, spoke some English to my benefit and helped us with everything. Front desk , Mr Dimas very helpful . Nearby to train station and malioboro road for shopping"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The location of the hotel is very good. It is across the road from the train station, which is very suitable for people who have to catch the train to the airport early in the morning. Next door is Malioboro Street, which is convenient for shopping and eating in the evening. I booked a suite. In fact, the so-called suite is only 33 square meters, but it is quite spacious visually. The advantage is that the price is relatively cheap and matches the price. Breakfast is on the second floor and starts at 6 o'clock. The variety is super rich and there are many local specialties. It is very delicious! The only dissatisfaction is that bottled water is not provided."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Rio Indralaksono,4.0,"This is one of the best hotels in a great location.  The breakfast is good enough for a 4 star hotel. The Deluxe room is also spacious.

However, I do not recommend that you make long-term plans to stay at this hotel, especially if you are a company that needs to make detailed budgeting beforehand.  The reason is, prices at this hotel are highly volatile. Some companies may need to make sure their budget is planned accurately."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Ila S,5.0,"Location: Very convenient. Hotel located right opp. Train station. Recommended to take the train to and fro Airport as it's more convenient and faster. Not recommended if you're a light sleeper or prefer a quiet area as train horns can be heard as and when. 5-10mins walk to Jln. Malioboro for shopping, easy to find food and Mart is everywhere. |Hotel: Friendly staffs, from security, front, fnb and housekeeping staffs. I'm particular when it comes to cleanliness and the hotel room is perfectly cleaned. Breakfast spread were awesome and good food as well.|Overall: Will come back again to stay for our next visit to Jogja! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Ulfatul Maula,5.0,"Very recommended, we requested several things and all are granted (connecting rooms, not in the corner, city view).

Top notch services, all employees were very kind and would greet you in the hallway. Location is perfect, you can just cross from the Yogyakarta's Tugu train station. The hotel is also a walkable distance from Malioboro street.

The rooms are clean, great amenities, provided 3 types of towels too. There was a welcome drink of ginger tea. Water is refillable through a water filter in the hallway.

Breakfast are complete too. Western food, traditional Jogja food, Javanese desserts, all available. Taste are okay. Would recommend taking the javanese bubur desserts as our family think that this is the best menu out of all.

I'd say with this price tag, the hotel is totally worth it. Would recommend to all travelers that seek for comfort."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Annisa Rianti,5.0,"first time stayed here and this hotel didnt disappoint. the service were top notch, the staff were all so helpful and the facilities were squeaky clean from the lobby to public toilets and room were all so clean, great job!

the room were not sound proofed and there's a train station just across the building, i personally didnt mind but if you're looking for a peaceful and quiet room, this is not the hotel for you.

the breakfast was just ok. menu were varied and well curated but i took some notes... the cold cut and cheese section weren't served in a chilled plate/ chiller, so the cold cuts were not served cold and they were dry too. fix thisss come on cold cuts are supposed to be served cold.

also, for the bread section, the restaurant can do much better with the bread and jam selection. come on, the bread and jam is clearly on the cheaper and lower quality side. this also applies for the sausage, it was clearly a low quality sausage and tasted cheap.

but other food were great. great selection of salad dressing btw! loved it. coffee and jamu were great too.

for me personally, the location is great bcs it is walking distance from the train station i literally walked 2 mins from and to the station, but again, it gets loud sometimes, because.. trains.

im so coming back to stay here again."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Greg Karpo,5.0,Rooms were 5 star. Great location.  Light supper at the pool bar was good. Aldo made our supper enjoyable and offered some great tips for a true Yogyakarta experience.
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Very satisfied. In a place where most people in Indonesia are dark and small, the waitresses in this hotel are all tall and fair-skinned girls, and their service is very enthusiastic. In addition, the location is also very good. It is only a few minutes' walk from the train station and Marioboro Commercial Street. There is a convenience store and a foreign currency exchange shop downstairs. The only thing I have to fault is, first, there is something wrong with the design of the room door. It cannot close automatically, which makes me uncomfortable. I often fall asleep without closing the door. Second, don’t give away bottled water"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,4.0,Nice small hotel.  Room is clean .  Just 6 mins walk from train station .  So going to airport is so much easier compared to taxi which the traffic is crazy .  The train ride is 40min.
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Veriska Riswanda,5.0,"This afternoon, i buy some cakes ,brownies and a milk bun. it's so viral in this town, so delicious, and good price. good job Mr. satria as pastry chef. i will back in this hotel, if i back in this town."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Brian Bonaparte,5.0,"I only visited the rooftop bar so I am commenting exclusively on the amazing experience I had there with Aldo as my friendly, highly professional waiter.

The service was prompt and I was instantly made to feel comfortable, not only by Aldo, but all the staff.

This place has a great view of Yogyakarta.

I arrived for my train to Surabaya earlier than expected and luckily chose this place to cool my heals.

Completely recommend!  I bet it’s a nice place to stay overnight too!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Fita Dani,2.0,"This good really nice, the place also good……. The staff really helpful … but they mostly said No for request….. such as i boooked 7 rooms, request for 1 room to early check in and request for late check out…… THEY ALWAYS SAY NO…….. 6 from 7 rooms was really check out (at 6.00 am in the morning)
I request late check out only for 2 hours (14.00) because i need to pack many stuffs…….
We booked 7 rooms for 5 nights it’s not the cheap one……
The person i talk about is their sales team, and even not trying to meet me in real also :)…….
Just try to upgrade the customer pleasant…… maybe for many people it’s not matter, but for me its REALLY matter
Thank you"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,nella novriyanti,5.0,"Wonderful experience ever..
1. Hotel is located at premium area, near to Malioboro and easy to find food stall surrounded.
2. Staff is very helpful & friendly. Room is clean & neat. Food also tasty as well, you can find many choices for breakfast.
3. The most memorable is about met the team who shown the truly hospitality manner. Special thanks to Bu Dena, Chef Firmansyah and Pak Wisnu. Wish you all success.
4. I wanna express my hug thanks to Chef Firmansyah who made our stay  really felt like home. From the welcoming until check out. Excellence service from A to Z. And please you have to try the opera cake.

Can't wait to visit Jogya & stay again at Royal Malioboro."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Marcel Overbeek,5.0,"Really perfect hotel for you’re value. The feeling is five star , but you pay for three star.. very , very good beds and facilities. I will come again.

Marcel Overbeek the Netherlands."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Pandu Raharja-Liu,5.0,"Very strategically located right by the train station and Malioboro. Perfect if you are arriving by the train from the airport (YIA) or your Java road trip.

Staff is very helpful. My concierge, Dimas, organized an early check in for me, which was extremely helpful.

Classy modern low key interior with a lot of traditional Jogja/Javanese elements."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Son manthaboi,4.0,"A very nice and comfortable hotel just opposite Tugu train station. I booked 2 connecting rooms. Very comfortable and pristine condition. I'm a member of the archipelago group. After few bad stays in jakarta via FAVE HOTEL, gave a try to stay at Aston. Its very nice and not disappointed. Breakfast buffet was good with good choices of food, but still be improved. Wifi was good and strong.Overall ok.. I used the pool at level 9 with my children and it was great with a good train station view.

Only problem is, the stretch of road could be crazily congested during peak hours. Pls plan your airport journey to the YIA AIRPORT. Do leave to the airport early as you may miss your flight in event of any bad congestion. Hotel currently don't provide airport transfer. Book a grab or gojek and it will be costly during peak hours and wee hours to the airport.

Plenty of food choices outside and opposite. Very very close to malioboro famous shopping street and to the plaza malioboro and beringharjo Market.

Overall good stay at this hotel and will strongly recommend to my friends and family."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Wahyu Dipo Carito,5.0,"More than just the best and trusted hotel in Malioboro...!
❤️❤️❤️

Yogyakarta is always special, especially when you stay in a wright place which present and deliver more than just a good service to your craziest moments.

Royal Malioboro Hotel Yogyakarta by Aston... which was huge hotel and have a lot of rooms which can accommodate our group, and strategically located near by the Malioboro's area and close to the city train station ( for sure it makes our group members very happy... ) surprisingly prove the word of ""SPECIAL"" itself.

The hotel itself was wondering...

The rooms were homy, clean, neat, quiet and smell good. And thanks a lot to always change my towels every single days.
❤️❤️❤️

The Food and Beverages were deliciously memorable. Especially the traditional dishes ( the Gudeg and the Koyor Mercon are my favorit ).

The services were lovely heart warming.

It's such a warm help from all of the hotel staffs and management in our daily hectic schedules for the week... Especially mbak Xenna ( Sales ) and ibu Vera ( GM ) who were always more than just happy give us an assistance every time we need.

Alhamdulillah... our a week busiest event was marked as an amazing moment because of these great help and assistances.

Trust me...!!!
For your convenience stay in Yogyakarta... Royal Malioboro Hotel Yogyakarta by Aston and Neo Malioboro by Aston are the name that you can trust.
☺️👍"

I was there for a meeting.
the place is clean and neat. no need for any comments.

Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Leno Christiannaldo,5.0,"Just a perfect experience during my recent trip to Yogyakarta. I choose to stay at Royal Malioboro by ASTON.

A beautiful hotel, friendly staffs. I really enjoyed my breakfast time here. Buffet really nice lots of choice.

Great service, will be going back."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Connor McGrath,5.0,"We weren’t staying at the hotel, however, we had dinner at the rooftop and were greeted delightfully by Aldo who was our waiter for the night. He was extremely friendly, accomodating and helpful. His English was fantastic also!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,riken saputra,5.0,"we stayed on November 12th. and we had a pleasant stay here.
the rooms are clean and comfortable.
all the employees are friendly and always say hello.
The choice of food for breakfast is also varied, including traditional local food.
the location is very close to Malioboro Street and tourist and shopping attractions.
100% will come back to stay here again."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The room was clean, close to the station, about a 5-minute walk from the city center, and quiet. Another recommended point is that it also has a pool gym."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Tian Hui Ng,5.0,"Great spot! With a view of Merapi and other volcanoes in the area! Surprisingly good gnocchi too! Great relaxing spot. Aldo, our waiter was terrific too!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,John Healy,4.0,"This is a very comfortable hotel. Rooms are clean and well serviced. The staff are very friendly and the breakfasts are very good.

A highlight of my four day stay was to head up to the lounge on Level 9 and to be looked after by Aldo. His manner was very welcoming and his English was great. Aldo went out of his way to be of assistance- even going to the shop to purchase items for me.  You are the reason for my 5 star service rating Aldo. Thank you."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Fred Lee Ahfei,5.0,"Dear Aldo
I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt appreciation for the outstanding service you provided during my recent stay at Royal Malioboro. Your professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine care made my experience truly memorable"
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,2.0,"If the price is more than 200 per night, I might consider staying there. If the price is more than 300 per night, don't stay there. It's not worth it. Comparing with the standard of domestic 2.3-star economical hotels.It cost about 260 yuan to stay in a room that day, without breakfast. I asked the hotel to ask if they could give me a breakfast coupon. The hotel refused decisively and told me that if I wanted to have breakfast, I would have to pay 70 yuan (the price after converting to Indonesian rupiah). I was shocked. Lao Tie, what kind of exquisite breakfast does your family need for this price? Why do you think Chinese people look like people who have been taken advantage of? I asked if I could have free breakfast, but the front desk refused in a non-negotiable tone.At 11 o'clock the next day, the hotel called to urge me to check out. . . Help, I have never lived in anything like this. ￼To be honest, I stayed at two hotels in Yogyakarta and both of them had a very bad experience. Except for this one, the other one was also rubbish (shown in the picture)Overall, I don't recommend this hotel because there are many hotels to choose from around. Please check out more.Finally, in Yogyakarta, the hotel conditions are not as good as in Bali. Don’t have high expectations. The price here is three to four hundred a night, which is not even up to the domestic level of one or two hundred. Please lower your expectations."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Hotel NEO is strategically located in front of Tugu Jogya station, near Maioboro, just a short walk away, the hotel is clean, the room layout is nice, neat, the bathroom is clean, the hot water is cool and the temperature is right, basically if you stay here you will definitely feel at home. Breakfast has a complete OK menu, the dining room is spacious and clean, there is air conditioning, there is a smoking room outside, breakfast at the Neo hotel is cool. If you go to Jogya, this is the recommended hotel of choice. The building is relatively new, the security receptionists are all friendly."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The hotel is in a very good location, right next to the train station. The transportation is very convenient. You can take a train directly to the hotel after getting off the plane. If you go to Surabaya, you can also get on the train from here, and it doesn't feel noisy. The breakfast was good. Surprisingly, the hotel restaurant can directly see the volcano, which is very shocking. The swimming pool is also nice."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Aryo Bimo Notohadikoesoemo,5.0,"Booking it on the site after came out from the Yogyakarta Station in a heavy downpour.
Not getting my choice of bed (that is the double one) but the FO initiatively suggested to combine the twin bed they have into one single bed....which i found it a good choice for me. The room was ready in no time. Good service indeed.

The breakfast also good. The location is just a walking distance from the Yogyakarta Train Station. Definitely will come back later"
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The room was ok in that price. But it was close to the street and was very noisy. Hard to sleep at night. Room was clean. In the hallway there were no windows, so walking from the room to the elevator was a challenge , because it stinks quite bad. But breakfast was compensating a lot. Very divers and good."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,3.0,"It's right across from Yogyakarta Train Station, so the trains are noisy. Neo has a unique ZEN atmosphere, and the cleanliness is honestly below expectations. I think the breakfast had the most variety in Jogja. Compare and if the price is affordable, I recommend it."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.0,"When I booked the hotel, Ctrip stated that the service desk had Chinese services. But when I checked in, the hotel said there were no Chinese services. The hotel front desk clerk was quite enthusiastic and used translation software to help us contact and arrange a chartered car, and was very patient. The hotel is very close to the train station. I will stay there again if I have the chance."

Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,3.0,"In terms of facilities, the price is a bit expensive. Fortunately, it is close to the train station, but the street is a bit noisy at night.

Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The location is good, diagonally opposite the Yogyakarta train station. Turn right when you go out and you will find Malioboro Street. There is a dedicated line from the train station to the airport in half an hour. There are buses on the street to Prambanan Temple (it is more convenient to come back). You can rent a car to go to the scenic spot.The room is okay. There is a water dispenser on the floor and a kettle in the room.The swimming pool is suitable for children, the breakfast is rich in variety, the service is good, and the price is high. It is worth recommending."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The place is cool, the rooms are also good, in the middle of the city. The service is also cool. There are lots of choices for breakfast.

Hotel NEO Malioboro,Shantanu Dutta,5.0,"Loved this place in every. The location. Close to the railway station, I took the train and back to Yogyakarta airport and walked from the station to the hotel. The rooms are great , the staff are so polite and thoughtful and the washrooms are spotless. The breakfast buffet is great though I felt the menu was about the same every day. Tonnes of shopping and eating options and the hotel connected me to an economical taxi operator for the sight seeing. I have nothing but praise for the place"

Hotel NEO Malioboro,Darren W,5.0,"The Orion room was spacious and the bed was comfortable, especially the pillows, leading to good night's sleep. The hotel location is great, close to shops and restaurants and also the train station (ideal if you're arriving/departing Yogya by train but not if you're a light sleeper due to train horns). I highly recommend including the breakfast when booking the room, as it is exceptional value with really good local and western foods to choose from.  Housekeeping and maintenance is excellent and the tv worked as expected and included some cable channels.  I would definitely stay here again on any future visits to Yogya."

Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Eric Effin' P - MTB Content,4.0,"Visited Feb '23

Staff - great. Polite and helpful.

Premise - quite well maintained. Very lush feel. Beside a mall. Pool is a tad too small. View was nice. Near to a mosque so expect prayer sound on the constant.

Room - big and nice. Smells good for smoking room. Odd was the light switches. Almost couldn't find the room lights but did not manage to find the toilet light switches. AC didn't work when arrived but was taken care thereafter. Apologies came in the form of fruit platters daily.

Overall, is a good place to stay. Not so much for staycation however due to small pool size. All else was good for a getaway if need be. Priced fair for the quality of hotel, can consider this hotel should you want a less crowded area."

Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,evan dewabrata,4.0,"The Staff is very helpfull and friendly. Always offer you help anytime you need with a big smile.

point to improve: will be much much better if the request to give review on the google, can be done after the guests are having their breakfast.. not in the middle of it."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,nureko l,5.0,"When I stayed here it was very comfortable, especially in the Wellness area, namely in the Gym and Swimming pool, there was Mr. Unggul Staff who was very helpful and friendly... Thank you Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Dini Kusumawardhani,5.0,"the room I was checked in has standard size, but the ceiling is high so it is fine and feels big. the service was really great; breakfast box will be prepared if you are in hurry to airport and have no time to eat breakfast, but you have to request it to the receptionist. meals at the restaurant were varied and delicious. I had a wonderful stay here!"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Koh Wee Liang,5.0,"The hotel is very clean and the service is top notch. The stuff always willing to help with a smile on a daily basis, as expected of a great customer service. The aircon is cold, wifi connection is great, toilet is clean and the bed/pillows are comfortable. All in all, one of the best hotel in Surabaya and one that I will come back again. The only downside for this hotel is wall is not exactly soundproof, noises and conversations from connecting rooms can be heard easily, there are instances when I open the door when the bell of the connecting rooms are pressed. Also the mall connected to the hotel (ciputra mall) is very empty with not much shopping /entertainment/ attractions"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Ayesha Aziz,5.0,"Always a preferred hotel in Surabaya due to its service, comfort, decor, breakfast with gluten free bread.
Hotel is connected to the mall which is a big facility.
After the pandemic, some elements can use renovation like carpets in the room look old, bathrooms can use and upgrade or touch up or a deep cleaning to cover up those corners which are collecting mold now.
Still the high quality of furniture and fixtures speaks of the hotel’s former glory."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,ZenRYL ReaDy,5.0,"i really love the skyview from infinity pool, their pool had the best view ive had so far among all the hotel in surabaya, and their service is excellent, thank you for staff rendra and baku for guiding me direction to the pool, ps: best photographer u could ever get"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,cis antono,5.0,"5 star hotel located in a big complex of mall, hotel, apartment and office. The hotel entrance is located at the backside of the mall and it has a direct access to the mall also.

The lobby:
Located on the 8th floor. A very clean and spacious lobby gives off the 5 star hotel vibes. Very friendly and helpful staff.

The room:
Great, a 5 star standard. However in my personal view the hotel can design a better design for the backboard of the bed. Amenities are standard, however no hair comb available. The floor is using carpet to minimize footsteps sound. The walls are not soundproof. I can still hear the noise from the next room. AC works well.

The facility:
Located on the 22nd floor. The swimming pool is quite small, but OK if it is not crowded. Gym has decent and complete equipment. They sell gelato also next to the gym.

The restaurant:
Located on the 7th floor. The restaurant is very clean. They served a variety of dishes, from dim sum, noodles, rice, traditional foods etc. The taste is OK but can be improved in my opinion."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Arbella Kusuma,5.0,"Had a great experience staying at Ciputra with my parent and family. Worth every penny! Room is beyond expectation, service is immaculate. Breakfast dishare could be better. Ayam semur and hot ginger are my favorite. Service during breakfast is Excellent especially Erin. Thanks Ciputra Hotel! Will be back."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Fanny PARENGKUAN,5.0,"Staffs are friendly with  excelent services. Excelent product knowledge. Fresh ambience at lobby  with beautiful flower arrangement , love the mascot BOTERO.. keep up the excellent work!!!!"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,thomas a,5.0,"I will tell you guys about my experience 7 days stay at this Hotel.||Best hotel with the worth price.|The staff really helpful and friendly, especially Unggul and Arif.|Breakfast at this hotel is so delicious too.|Room and  bed are comfy too.|Thankyouuuuuuuuu!!"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,れん（Ren）,2.0,"Pros:
1. attached to Ciputra shopping mall
2. I got upgraded to deluxe room because the standard non smoking room was fully booked
3. friendly staffs

Cons:
1. This hotel is monetizing too much from the parking charge, because if the drop off is more than 5 minutes, langsung kena parkir Rp 10.000.
I was so surprised the parking charge starts from 10.000 instead of 5.000 like in Jakarta. It’s too expensive, even for Surabaya standard.

2. The food quality and portion for breakfast was not satisfactory.
- the grilled tomato is not grilled at all, and it got funky smell like bau kain lap. I almost throw up when I taste it.
- the potatos only left like 3 pieces, it was not refilled. I had breakfast around 9AM so I wonder why the food has finished already
- same as potatoes, the baked beans also almost finished. And its overcooked.
- the cappuccino cup is sooo small. Not a proper cup for cappuccino. It tastes bland too.

3. The gym has too many gym equipment that it has no space for long mirrors for weightlifting area. This is the first time I found a gym in a hotel (and its a 5 stars hotel) that provide no space for weight lifting. I had to scoop near the wall to find a space.
I mean, not everyone goes to the gym untuk pakai alat only or treadmill only. A gym is supposed to cater all means of working out.

3. The main door for ladies’ toilet and sauna room cannot be closed properly, jadi pintunya selalu agak sedikit terbuka. People need privacy for sauna, so it makes me so uncomfortable.
Plus, the locker is outside the room. It would be more convenient to have a locker inside the room so that we can have more privacy."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,George,1.0,"Very luxurious but dated, the windows are single pane so even on th 19th floor be prepared to enjoy a religious concert at least 4 times a day starting at 4.30 am..Also the walls are very thin, you can hear the telephone ringing from the room next door"
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,amir p,5.0,Great Hotel Thanks to Miss Atika from Front desk  who is friendly  and very helpfull.|And also the room were clean and tidy thanks to Ainal|great breakfast and tasty too|near to city and office .....|the room perfect cozy great for relaxing after busy day
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Alhamdi Yosef,5.0,"Good hotel with circle concept, and infinity pool on the rooftop.
Some annoying is odd painting the fat lady in balerina pose, same pose only different angle. Then the elevator has not sound notification when has arrived, so we don't know if the elevator has been come or not if not starely to three elevator door every second."
Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Ziarini Karmiadji,5.0,"Second stay here every end year holiday. Always superb service. Room is spacious, breakfast is terrific, and staff especially breakfast service staff is tremendously friendly and helpful. Always recommended to stay in Ciwo."

Ciputra World Hotel Surabaya,Anna Minami,5.0,The Staff is very helpfull and friendly. Got a free room upgrade! The pool view is totally mesmerizing.
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Dory S,5.0,Great hotel with great facilities and excellent service. I got a last-minute upgrade to room 1905 with a city view. The room is clean and big enough for me. Breakfast is great and has many options. They give afternoon tea that's so nice after a hectic meeting all day. It really made my day. thank you for all of the staf for being so helpful and great service
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Ryan Goh,4.0,"The location is ""centrally"" located but not near anything that a tourist would go. luckily taxi is cheap
Hotel facilities is tip top with room furnished well.
The services and smile provided by the staff is great, you truly felt welcome
breakfast selection was great and their staff take an effort to remember which drink do you like to have
to kick-start a good day

housekeeping however is a slight letdown with inconsistency, upon arrival the room was missing certain towel eg face towel. towel type was inconsistent (certain day i have 2 different kind of bath towel which i couldnt differentiate whether its foot towel) , tissue box was not setup properly

overall its still a good stay and would definitely be back"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Andriani Suharto,5.0,"A very nice place to stay in Surabaya. Comfortable bed, very clean room, and fast room service. But the breakfast is not that good and the price for room service food is a bit expensive"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Faizal Ardiansyah,5.0,"Excellent service. 2nd time returning after the rebrand from Grand Mercure.

Front House: easy, seamless, n hassle free check in. Professional n friendly curtesy.

F&B: Excellent food & service quality. A wide range of culinary selection at breakfast, fitting a person like me well who lives abroad seeking a local delicacy back home. A special mention to Sabrila who went the extra mile, making sure we had a great breakfast experience. Also, a very nice surprise knowing that I was entitled to an (proper) afternoon tea. I almost didn't need dinner.

Housekeeping: Excellent bedding n linen quality. I slept well. I have overall enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

One room for improvement when possible; a special attention to the bathroom in regards to stains n mould treatment and prevention as well as the overall maintenance standards. Perhaps a functional, fit for purpose, exhaust system and could help improve this.

Interestingly, I have also seen this across other Accor brands (Novotel, Mercure, Grand Mercure) I've visited in the country. So, I am not sure if it is a generally accepted a rather high tolerance to mould and stains or just an oversight to the housekeeping & maintenance standards at the national/corporate level."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Alex R,5.0,Great stay at the Movenpick. I had a fantastic meal in the restaurant. Vidi helped me to pick some local dishes and explained the food to me as I had never been to Indonesia before. Great service and perfect recommendations by him. I look forward to visiting again
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Jessica S.,4.0,"I had spent 6 Nights here with my family.
They had high occupancy due to peak season of holiday.
But their staff still accommodate our needs very well.
Thank you for all the hard work of the hotel team member."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,5.0,"bromo sewu Stayed for a day after returning home from fun. It was great. The breakfast was rich. It was very thrilling to go out and cross the road😎. There was a big shopping mall nearby, not the one next door! ! It's also close to the airport, less than 30 minutes by taxi."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Nario Anggoro,5.0,A really great hotel with a very nice interior. The interior was well maintained and tidy. There were swimming pool and gym with treadmill & several weight lifting equipment. The only minor disadvantage was location which located around 5 km from city center. But it was located very near to the bus stop.
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Didik K,5.0,"VERY CLEAN, WELL DESIGNED. Large size room, giant size bed, clean, comfort. Windows are great sound proofed, so traffic noise doesn't matter at all. Breakfast quality is decent. Thanks to restaurant staff Ms Dhea for serving us very very well. Location is a bit far from city center"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Masniaritta Pohan,5.0,"Hotel is really nice, clean, and comfortable. The staff is extremely helpful. Shout out to Miss Nurul Fida who always ready to help which makes my stay at Movenpick memorable."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Sin Tee Jeremy Beh,5.0,"Great hotel ever with nice room which I has been upgraded to a bigger room.

We had last minutes dinner at the 7th floor and the Staff name Miss Nova was very attentive and providing an excellent service as they almost closing. Semhe even served us the fruits platter as she knew her kitchen chef will take longer time to cook our food. All the time, she came and check on us and make sure we are comfortable. Thumbs uo for Miss Nova and she deserved a compliment from customer. And credit to her. BRAVO.....
I saw her in the next day morning breakfast and she greeted me again with warm welcome and make my day with a smile!
Good job, Miss Nova and hope to see you soon."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Ega Widjaja,5.0,"Great Stay at Movenpick Surabaya. Very clean, comfortable, and luxurious rooms. Very good breakfasts. Friendly staff. Special thanks to the staff at the breakfast restaurant for providing personalized service for us because of our Platinum membership. Easy check in and check out process and great value for money. The only downsides of this hotel is I think the parking space is a bit cramped and the gym is quite limited for a 5-star hotel.
We would love to come back to stay here again."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Timotius Wibowo,5.0,"This review is for the Patita restaurant at Mövenpick. Had a buffet dinner there during Christmas.

Food: Was worth it for the price of the buffet. Taste was decent and the variety was within expectation.

Service: the staff were friendly. They were very prompt and very attentive to guests. Some junior staff members seems new to the job and less knowledgeable about their offerings but this doesn't detract from the clear passion and dedication to service that they have.

Ambiance: The Patita restaurant has good and tasteful interiors."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,App App,5.0,"The room is very comfort with city view from 11th floor. Breakfast is a lot of menus and Happy with thematic lebaran menu lontong cap gomeh also kids food popcorn, rambut nenek. Overall is great and highly recommended to stay here"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Tegar Ilma Noor,5.0,"First time visit surabaya and we are lucky enough to get a room In movenpick hotel even in the  peak holiday season..overall the hotel, the room, services, and breakfast menu was  great. Such a pleasure experience. Sure enough we will visit agaain next time."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Firstian Kautsar Adiguno,5.0,"Movenpick Surabaya City is the first Movenpick hotel that I stayed, ever. The pre-arrival communication went well, my request was very well accommodated. During check-in, I was told about the hotel's situation and facilities. As a Platinum member, they escorted me into my room, what a welcome!
Welcome cake and fruit are already on the table, and room AC is already on.
Afternoon High Tea is offered as a complimentary benefit, to substitute the absences of the hotel lounge. The options are offered via phone, directly when I arrive in the room. It will be delivered to the room whenever I am ready.
Options were quite generous and the snacks were delicious. I came during Ramadhan, so the snacks were considered a pre-Iftar meal (takjil).

I tried the small gym and relaxed at the poolside while waiting for the Iftar time. At night I took a welcome drink at the bar, but the options were not that much (coffee, tea, and juice only).

Since it's Ramadhan I took sahur meal instead of breakfast. While the options are limited, I can enjoy a freshly brewed tea that is offered by the assistant. Very well assured they acknowledged their elite member.

Check-out situation went fast and no drama to end my short 1-night stay in this brand new hotel (reformed from Grand Mercure, previously).
Still curious to feel the full breakfast experience and (hopefully) when the new lounge is ready. See you!"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Jogja English.Magazines,5.0,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights, and it was a very satisfying experience. The room was clean, the service was excellent, the breakfast was good, the check-in process was smooth, and it was a relatively new hotel, so the bedding and towels were in good condition. In particular, I would like to thank Mr.Dimas, who works at the restaurant, and I would like to thank him again for being able to stay comfortably and happily throughout my stay with such kind and thoughtful service. If I have a chance, I would like to visit the hotel again."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Jason Tan,5.0,"Had a delightful supper experience at Patita restaurant during the late hours. The staff Miss Nova, displayed excellent customer service and sincere welcome that make my day."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Marlin (Bre),5.0,"The staff are just amazing. Cicik, Vida and Dimas, they are completely helpful and super kind during my 3-night stay there. They asked what I fancy for the following day breakfast, then on the morning everything was ready. Superrrrrb… They never skipped asking how my stay felt like, what need to be improved to satisfy the experience.

Also, the receptionist team did a great job, helped me reschedule the booking time; Not a automatic machine talking on the phone.

Will certainly recommend this hotel to everyone while lookin for accomodation in Surabaya. The room is super cozy and convenient."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,3.0,"The hotel is very noisy, and there is a place like an amusement park below. People sing until midnight, which is very uncomfortable for those who go to bed early. The sheets are not clean either, there are a lot of mud spots that haven't been cleaned"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The location is ok. On the one side of the hotel there is a small convenient store, on the other side there is an old small shopping center (Hollowed) which comes with a few eateries. Royal Plaza has more food choices but it takes 15-18 minutes walk and you have to go around to pass the railway tracks to get there. The traffic at the railway intersection is very bad so you better to take Grab to go to Royal Plaza. The room is clean and room size is ok. The TV is good size and has good programs. There is a safe box, but no bathtub in the room I stayed. The buffet breakfast and dinner are ok. The AC at the dining area is not cold enough. The staff are friendly and helpful. The train tracks are very close to the hotel so don’t choose the rooms that face the tracks if you prefer quiet environment."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,hanif syauqi,5.0,"Awesome.. The Hospitality is best, Foods are delicious, recommended for Ramadan Staycation.. Enjoy, relax & happy.. Thank u for your service Miss NOVA (F&B) @Patita Restaurant 7th floor"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Stephen Christian,2.0,"Staff is friendly and willing to listen to complain.
Check in was easy but elevator is having long queue (understandable for holiday period)
Entering the room, room is spacious but toilet is smelly. You can hear water sound from other room as well as bell sound from other room. Toilet is smelly, hand towel and shower cap only available upon request BUT room phone is not working.
What troublesome the most is PARKING. Since parking is limited, hotel provides valet. But 2 times I use it, two times i need to wait my car for long period when collecting since it blocked by other car (for sure one occassion they say my car is blocked by other car  that didnt use valet service). You can imagine if the owner of the car taking nap or go swimming, how can I collect my car?!
I did complain directly to hotel but only received by MOD as duty manager is not available."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,3.0,The first room we got had many ants so we were given another nicer room. The room was spacious and comfortable with amazing bathtub. The only concern is the cleanliness of the hotel which could be improved so as to live up to 4 - 5 stars standard.
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Jonathan J,4.0,"Hotel design and rooms are very tastefully decorated and looks modern yet inviting. Location wise is not in the most central location of Surabaya but pretty well accessible. Only downside is there's a train track right across the hotel so you'd hear clearly when there's a train passing. Hotel has clear potentials but lacking some finesse like some dirty walls in the room, very used and torn towels (didn't feel very comfortable using it), and the sink faucet that sprays water everywhere every time you use it. Hope it can be improved."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Wattson 88,5.0,"I left and lost my wallet at the lobby toilet.
Within 2 hours, the hotel staff and security traced it and found.. Great hospitality and responsibility. All the stuff back to me. Thanks alot, superb!!"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Needed to pay extra for highway fee to the hotel, not far from the airport. Hotel was standardised 5 star hotel and the food portion at the restaurant was big and inexpensive! Enjoy our dinner there!"
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Trip.com Member,4.0,"nearby airport , 30mint distance from airport . room is beautiful n comfortable but the tower is dirty ,breakfast is not tasty . service is great . overall this hotel not matching with 5 star , consider 4 star hotel ."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Lilir Bali,5.0,"The breakfast is huge variety, and so tasty. The room and the view is nice."
Mövenpick Surabaya City,Yulia Natania,5.0,"I appreciate the small to medium-sized hotel. The rooms are modern, clean, and spacious. However, the swimming pool is small, and the breakfast is just okay."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,No issues and pleasant place to stay. Front office staff and friendly and knowledgeable. Makes things smooth.Please review the bathroom mold and shower heads. Most of the heads are broken and sprayed in wild directions. And shower heads are moldy.Will visit again
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,Shower area cleanliness can be further improved. Specifically … molds and damaged shower head. I have stayed in this hotel in the past. Roaches were crawling all over in the room. But I don’t see them anymore. Congrats for taking care of this pest problem. Will consider Great Diponegoro hotel again in future visits.
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Nice, it's just that the parking lot is full, always manage it yourself... at an affordable price you can get a good hotel like this, overall very satisfied, thanks trip.com"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Comfortable, very good, can you get a room on the 11th floor, you can see the view of the city of Surabaya, service is also ok, cleanliness is ok"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Selvia Chan,5.0,"Went there bcz of a wedding invitation. A small but located in the heart of the city - hotel. Staffs are friendly. Toilet are quiet clean. They were very responsive as at my friend's wedding. They take the dirty plate as long as wes finished eat. So theres no mess everywhere.
But the parking lot are very hard to find. We have to park at the street - which are very dangerous. Their lift are so small and a bit slow."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Harry Kalsumajaya,4.0,"Though bedsheets some rooms may seem yellowish, the cleanliness of the rooms is still acceptable. Decent breakfast at the decent location. Parking wise may be cramped, but looking at the rate of the hotel, this hotel gives a proper satisfaction for tenants to sleep through the night without worry. Well recommended at its price."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Very clean hotel, location is also very suitable for looking for food at night"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Irwan Fithrony,5.0,"Love the suite room, so comfy, love the couch, so clean, if the bathroom lil bit spacy it will be great. Hopes they'll upgrade their food taste, that will be great as same with their hotel name."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Lovation is good, near kfc and indomaret.. Too bad on the second day the water is dirty 😞"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,KoIn Company,5.0,"Staff here were super kind.
Room was good and cheap."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Samsul Ishak,4.0,A night stay in between journey. Small room but served the purpose. Good location.
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,K B,5.0,"Great value! Very clean rooms with comfortable beds, cold AC & hot showers. We had one night between hiking volcanos in Java and flying to Thailand so this was a great place to relax and get a good nights sleep. It’s less than a 10 minute drive to the Tunjugan Plaza mall and there are some good restaurants nearby."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Richfield Seven,4.0,"The location is good because it is in the city center. Close to malls and other public facilities. Right next door to a mini mart and fast food restaurant. It's just that breakfast is not good and the price of milk ordered to be delivered to the room can change at any time. There is no bell boy to help carry our luggage. Parking ramps are slippery when it rains and parking spaces are very limited. The room is less soundproof from the hallway, next room and traffic around the hotel. But, the room rate is very affordable."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Ariesta Wibisono Anditya,5.0,"Despite the compact-sized building, the value still incomparable to other hotels around. Cleanliness, hospitality, the offered entertainment, food & beverages are valuable."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The suit type rooms are really recommended, the prices are very cheap for the suit type & view, standard service, cleanliness, SOP, right?"
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Dew Yo,1.0,"Salah satu resepsionis yang kerja shift handle operational jam 12.00 - 14.00 tanggal 17 August 2023, have such a bad gesture. Kerja di hospitality tapi lack of say sorry and thank you. Bad to know we have such a bad experience from her."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Not the first time ya stay here. But the longer it takes, the worse it gets. The staff is a bit unfriendly. In terms of cleanliness, it's already lacking, now it's getting worse. Dirty sheets. Kettles and glasses dusty. There are cockroaches. Wifi off2. And maybe you can add a swimming pool. There is a deposit for the key of 50k. The checkout process is a bit long, especially when you're already in line, it's like there's not enough employees. At night there is no security and the hallway is a dark room."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The hotel is clean, the service is also good, it's just that the rooms are a bit cramped and not soundproof, so you can still hear it from outside to the room and also like playing songs that make it annoying."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,5.0,"I've stayed there several times, it's still good and it doesn't disappoint at all. Clean, smell good, cold ac, fast wifi, good view, clean bathroom, all the amenities are very good."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,juan wong,2.0,"The room is not clean. I found bugs. There's a leak from the air conditioner. Above the AC, there is waterways, which result noises during almost a long night. Breakfast ok, but not so tasty, it is probably during the fasting period."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Call To Glory,5.0,"I love this hotel. The room is spacious and clean, the bathroom is clean too, the city view is also very beautiful. The price is cheap and the breakfast is not bad. The location is strategic, only 14 minutes from Pasar Turi station, next to KFC and near minimarket."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,"This hotel is at center of the city, near awesome place and many transportation available here. The place is cozy, enjoyable, cheap, service is good, and comfortable. The room is clean, receptionist always ready, and have some facility at upstairs. I haven't enjoy the room service because this is month of fasting, but one day i will. Keep the good service."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Lidwina Arin,5.0,"Excellent location, there is KFC across the street, and next to Indomaret point with BCA and BNI ATM service. Easy access to Tunjungan Plaza. The staff is also friendly. I spent 2 nights here and it was such a pleasant moment. There is welcome drink, you can choose either coffee or tea in their rooftop bar. The view in rooftop bar is so pretty especially in the dusk if the sky is clear. The room is comfy too and not spooky."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Rahmat J,5.0,"Didn't know what to expect, I booked one night. Boy, how regretful I was. Wish I stayed longer. ||Bed & pillow were super comfortable. And the surprise? BOLSTER...! I immediately feel at  home & indeed, I slept like baby.||AC was okay, but the hot water pressure was consistently great, and it made my ritual of hot shower before going to bed perfectly kept.||One thing I noticed is how the attention to detail is given to ensure the cleanliness is kept around the clock. 4 times I went to the public toilet and the seat is ALWAYS dry and clean. Yes, I have an serious case of OCD & yet I can't fault the cleanliness.||Although a bit dark in Reception desk, Putri the receptionist is always eager to assist. The others need to learn from her professional hospitality attitude. Lobby is small but functional. The Hall meeting room is spacious. My meeting arrangement was easily accommodated and professionally well taken care of by Freshi Moreno. A big thank you for extending your flexibility toward my changing meeting arrangement need.||Breakfast selection was varied & satisfying but the group's loud chatters turned off my  appetite slightly.||Location is great, rate is affordable but at  product this good it should've fetched a few more rupiah. ||Concussion: Stay here. Period. Highly recommended."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,G Andika,5.0,"Only spent a night for a transit in Surabaya and really love the place. The room was nice, though not very spacious. Had various breakfast selections and really enjoyed the meal served—love the way they handle the meats. The staffs were so helpful and hospitable. It's also easy to access many parts of the city from here."
Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Harry Ryana,5.0,"Decent place for transit hotel. Room is comfortable. AC working ok. Great location. Near KFC, Indomaret and other interesting place. Although limited breakfast choice but the taste is really good.  Stay on superior room with connecting door and enough space for my family."

Great Diponegoro Hotel Surabaya,Ernestine O. Yuniswara,4.0,"Stayed for one night company meetings. Decent room overlooking Jalan Diponegoro, too bad mine smelled like cigarette. Friendly & helpful staff. Nice rooftop dining hall, great for a change of view."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,k drama f,5.0,"The hotel is strategically located nearby a small shopping mall. There is an art shop next to it as well. There are a lot of restaurants around the hotel.||The parking area is spacious as the hotel is using the parking space of the mall.||My family was greeted upon reaching the lobby and the receptionist was friendly and informative. Parking is free by showing the parking coupon provided by the receptionist.||There is free coffee with coffee machine (similar to nespresso) available at the lobby.||Luggages were delivered to my room promptly even though it was during the hari raya period.||First impression of the room: Spacious and clean! It is not easy to find spacious hotel at this price nowadays.||My son fell sick during my stay and lucky enough that this Artotel is very close to a big hospital i.e. Mayapada Hospital. My family can move swiftly from the hospital to the hotel and vice versa.||We booked 2 rooms for 3 nights each (booked through Agoda, but regretted it as booking through official website was much cheaper T.T). Due to my son’s hospitalisation incident, i was allowed to rearranged my booking to 1 room for 2 nights and 1 room for 4 nights. This helped my family a lot as we needed to stay a bit longer in Surabaya. The management was very kind to to it for us.||Room was completed with bath tub and separate bathroom and toilet.||Overall, we enjoyed our stay there. Thanks so much Artotel :)"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,refi x,3.0,"The CEO Suite Room was the best decision. It only has one bedroom but with a very open space balcony. It's an experience like living in 1 big room apartment with full furnished, huge living room, mini kitchen, and you can invite some friends to meet privately. We love the ambience room. ||For deluxe room are just fine. ||But a little unconvenient, for the empty space and dark floor on the 2nd - 3rd floor which sometimes open even we don't press the button. And the exterior building need a retouch. It's actualy a nice hotel. So, it might looks spooky for some ppl.||Fyi, the hotel was opposite to KFC. But quite far to Tunjungan Plaza.||Oh, not forget to mention, We got excellent service from Mr Ano for the information of the hotel, bringing our bag just in time, and make us feel comfort with the hotel, thank you. ||Anw, If you buy the room from apps, please reconfirm to the hotel before checking in, it might be a different room. ||Hope to see you in a better face Artotel TS Suite 💖 Thank you for your service."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Wijaya K,4.0,"one of my favourite hotel in surabaya. since i celebrate my birthday here, the hotel management gave me a slice of birthday cake and the room is decorated very nice. i really appreciate it.|unfortunately, the pillow sheet is a little bit smelly. the breakfast taste is so so"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Howard G,4.0,"The room is spacious and clean. |Some things I’d like to highlight are:|- There were no welcome drinks upon arrival.|- The fitness center is closed. |For a city hotel without a swimming pool, alternative facilities for guests should be considered.||This place just needs some care and attention. It has a lot of potential, with friendly staff at the front desk and in the breakfast restaurant."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Really worth the price!!!This is a 4 star hotel but felt like a 5 star! The room was clean, wide, nice interior and got a clean bath tub!! It got separated shower and toilet and amenities were complete. I'm not even sure I will get the same benefit from a 5-star around here.Breakfast buffet had lots of choices with decent taste. Coffee was very nice!!They also had a gym room and a bar. Service was also nice and helpful. Definitely will come back again!"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.0,"The location is good, with affordable prices. First check in the hotel staff not informed us about the facilities and breakfast time, etc but it’s fine. We stayed for 2 nights, after the 1st night the hotel texted me and informed us to move to another room because our floor have regular maintenance (they even didn’t mention it during our check in). The 2nd night we moved to the other room but the key is not working 🥹 we have to back and forth to the reception still didn’t work, the hotel staff asked to move to another room 😪. The room is not too clean as I still can see the dust in some areas, and the toilet was leaking, quite disappointed. Hope they can improve the service and maintenance"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Ferry F,5.0,"Staying here for a bussiness trip, warm welcome from the hotel security, helpfull front office officer. ||The room was spacious and clean, nice bathroom large bathub.||Stay at 3rd floor but the room was comfortable without noise from the street.||Would absolutely stay at this hotel again on the next trip"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The room is really nice. Very comfortable, suitable for families or honeymoons. Come at 9pm, my staff are friendly and provide very good service.. informative and will definitely come back to the Artotel Suites Surabaya hotel when on holiday with the family.. the food is really delicious, really perfect, the hotel is good .. 🥰🥰🥰"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Resty S,5.0,"Very spacious room, yet so comfy and the room has a giant scenery window. I enjoy every details of the room, how it had a great bathtub so you can relax and watch the tv in the same time, and the staffs are very helpful, starting from the lobby to the dinning area.|Thank you and I can't wait to be back again."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.0,"No swimming pool, but have bath tub. Each room has carpet, just it seems so worn out. The service is so so. As understood there is flexibility on check-out time, but only for direct customer. Breakfast is ok, many variety, just need to be more tasty."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Paul Basuki,5.0,Love it.. The room is very spacious and the bathroom is great too. Breakfast is very nice too with many varieties on offer. Only the TV is very old and too small for today standard.
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Wow, I'm really excited to be staying here. Starting to check in was very slow. Had to wait half an hour for the room to be ready, even though it was already 3 o'clock. Room cleanliness was lacking, the bed covers and towels smelled musty. The restaurant is hot, I don't know what the concept is without air conditioning."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Arlinka Larissa,3.0,"Update: They refunded my second night and took action swiftly to rectify their mistakes. Please continue improving.

—

Room was old, so were all the furnitures and amenities such as pillows and towels (they were greying). My second night, there was a power outage and even though the hotel staff tried to be helpful, they didn’t give a satisfactory solution, instead transferring me to a nearby hotel of worse quality. Probably management troubles, but it was a major inconvenience for me during a tiring business trip. If not for the power outage saga, I would’ve given it 3 stars."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,elsyaaa,5.0,"The staff at Artotel Surabaya are commendable for their professionalism and friendliness, providing excellent service throughout my stay. Custumer service excellence ||However, there is a notable issue with the strong fragrance in the hallways and elevator, which can be overwhelming and cause headaches. ||Overall, while the staff's performance is exemplary, improvements are needed regarding the intensity of the fragrance in the common areas."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Aziz A,4.0,"Good and comfortable room, clean bath room and very helpful staf.|It will be better if :|A. There is a hanger for towel/s|B. Provide some tray to place some clothes.|C. Parking lot is available any time.|I would suggest you if you are visiting Surabaya, do not miss it to book this hotel."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Nurmalela L,5.0,"The room is so comfortable and wide|The surroundings are clean, the reseptionis, and every body so kind to us, we like this hoyel so much, we stayed with our grand child and they like the hotel very much, they love to stay there because they could spent much time at bathroom..cause the bathtub is so clean and looks good with plenty of clean water..lovely ever"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Karel Pramono,4.0,Came to this hotel for a piano competition held at their ballroom. Reception was very helpful yo our question for directions to the ballroom. Some unique arts on display when we were there. Parking is a bit sketchy -- but not was a major issue.
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Frederik Cavadino,4.0,"As 1 of only a handful hotels in SBY with a bath tub we booked it for it's spacious and affordable room and being in a good area. Newly renovated, very friendly staff and the fun room with a sliding wall totally opening up the bathroom to the bedroom, such that you sit in the bath in the middle of the room looking out over SBY skyline made it special. Few remarks..... lighting switches have a strange set up; from the bed it is either all lights on or off. Adn near the bathroom a switch for all lights in bathroom on or off. Not handy as you light up the whole room, waking your partner, during a mid-night toilet break. Also; it will provide some preferred privacy to make the glass in the toilet door non-transparent. Breakfast was good; they were still busy renovating this area. Note to hotel; make sure your egg-baking cook wears clean clothes..... Overall, definitely value for money and a great place to stay in SBY."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Nicholas Pratama,3.0,"I made a booking for this 4-star hotel that had a high rating of 9.0 on Agoda. However, upon arriving at the hotel, I was disappointed to find that the room did not meet my expectations. Although the room was spacious, it was inadequately lit, and I could see spots of dust on the furniture. The bathroom had moldy patches, and the quality of the linen was subpar. I couldn't help but wonder if the hotel was located in an old, unused mall or some other abandoned building. The only redeeming qualities of the hotel were the size of the room and the staff's hospitality."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Second experience staying here. always satisfying, really worth it, friendly service, got a spacious room, big bath, clean, comfortable room, there is a coffee machine, refrigerator, no problems at all. Even though there's no swimming pool, it's no problem. Only this second stay I was disappointed with the breakfast dishes, this time it didn't taste as good as the first stay, all the menus tended to be bland, some even had saltiness. Meanwhile, at the first breakfast, almost everything on the menu was delicious"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Spacious rooms, spacious bathrooms, large bathtubs, complete amenities. There are quite a lot of food variations but the taste is just ordinary. The room is not soundproof so the sound of music from outside or the sound of other guests closing the door can be heard loudly"
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,MF Worker Guide Sam (Febri),5.0,"I visited the hotel for a scientific dental discussion. Artotel surely at different 4-star level as expected.
Next to the hotel is the Sutos. Sutos used to be very crowded, active place before pandemic, now it's bit abandoned with only 3-5 vendors left."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Dena A,5.0,• a comfortable and warm place to stay|• the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful|• always an option when staying in Surabaya||Thankyou Artotel Ts Suites Surabaya🤍
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Ellen Setiawan,2.0,"Honestly a good location and the staff is really nice. Chose this hotel because it was close to Mayapada hospital and the staff provided us extra bedding to make us feel comfortable after surgery. However, we stayed here for 6 nights and all 6 nights and days there was loud music blasting from the mall below which made existence just unbearable in our room. Also all the towels and sheets are very old and no longer white. Bathroom fixtures can be updated."
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,3.0,basic hotel in surabaya. fine for 2 nights. the tub is nice but the water doesn’t get very hot. the towels are really old and quite smelly. couch is also quite old and dirty. wifi is mostly decent. air con is super loud. toilet fan also really loud

ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Trip.com Member,4.0,the room is spacious and got a room on the top floor so the city view is good. only for cleanliness it is still lacking because there is some dust on the carpet and there are cutouts of coffee sachets next to the room
ARTOTEL TS Suites Surabaya,Tanti Kusriandini,5.0,"The bathroom was so nice. Love the design & cleanliness.
The details were the best :
1. put on smaller size of tiles on the shower room to avoid slippery floor
2. Textured wall on the shower room
3. Provide coffee capsule

Nothing special on breakfast, just usual menu with a fewer kind of fruits

Overall its a pleasant stay!"

ASTON INN Jemursari,Maria Lanovia,4.0,"Clean and modern interior. Great location, affordable. Nice touch by providing Google Home Nest.

Things can be improved:
1. Improve the room maintenance. My shower drain clogged. I needed to pull it up to let the water flew.
2. Towels looked old as well. Can be replaced.
3. Breakfast spread was okay, although some hot foods served cold.
4. Called receptionist 3x to ask about the sink, but didn’t get the response. I went down to talk to them directly and they apologised bcs they were attending other check in guests"
ASTON INN Jemursari,Ari Saptawijaya,4.0,"Good price. Smart room with Google Nest. We came on Jan 2nd, unfortunately the swimming pool was not yet cleaned, where rest of small paper on the surface and the bottom of the ppol (like those popped from confetti or fireworks). Perhaps it was from the New Year's party. Parking is rather limited with free valet provide, where you have to leave your car's key with them."

ASTON INN Jemursari,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Aston Inn Jemursari has a very small parking lot, making it difficult for guests who bring vehicles (even though valet parking is provided by the hotel).The breakfast menu can't expect much, because what you get is what you pay for.Modern rooms, but cleanliness can still be improved.The staff is quite friendly, but the receptionist doesn't work fast enough.Located on a small street, not on the main road."

Bedroom not spacious but very comfy and clean. All functioned well. Each room had a small balcony. They also provide refrigerator and hair dryer in each room which was very great for 3-star hotel. I think it could be 3,5-star hotel despite of the narrow parking area and the bedroom size. Very recommended."
