The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Jim D,5.0,"This is a fantastic hotel and a wonderful introduction to Indonesia.   We had a very comfortable pool overlook room for 4 nights and very much enjoyed returning each night to the hotel for a swim and to our comfortable room.  ||The included breakfasts were a highlight - we particularly liked the wide range of food, particularly Indonesian food, available.  Further the  staff were happy to guide us on how the locals eat the food and how to mix the various tonics.  The staff were also happy to fill our drink bottles for our days exploring Jogja.  ||The hotel is well located - close to the airport rail station and there are banks with ATM machines close by."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Maja G,4.0,"We spent 2 nights there with our 2 boys (age 15 & 18).  The staff were brilliant, 10/10 for the service.  The beds were very comfortable too and we loved the views from the balcony over the pool.  The rooms were lovely and cool given the outside temperature too.  The hotel was centrally located and given that it was also Ramadan, we were surprised how quiet our rooms were.  What bliss after such a long flight from the UK.  The boys loved the gym and highly recommend it. All the hotel need to do is improve the food.  Breakfast was immense but it really focussed on high processed foods and sugar.  Offering less of a selection ""of everything"" and focussing on quality and not quantity might be a winning formula at the Phoenix."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Susan S,5.0,"Beautiful old hotel, with many special touches.  Our suite was lovely.  Big bathroom with tub & lovely amenities.Dining areas were grand…so many stations for food from all over the world.  |Lots of meal options.  A gorgeous pool.  Used the spa for massages."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Jan-Markus H,4.0,"If you like mix of colonial with Indonesian flavor, this is your hotel. The hotel is a bit rustic and old, thus beautiful decorating, rooms are okay but old fashioned. Hotel has nice pool area and ok gym. Also, spa with massage is there. |Breakfast buffet has nice selection but my disappointment was cold food even if I was one of the first at the breakfast. Hopefully they will better in this."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Md Aman,3.0,Heritage hotel located near the Yogyakarta Monument. Posts of antiques and artifacts on display all around the hotel giving it a colonial feel. The room was nice and cozy and loved the balcony with view of the pool. However the room was located at the far end  which required a long and maze like walk to get to the lobby and restaurant. Accessibility within the hotel could be improved. The buffet breakfast had a good mix of western and local cuisine. Staff were polite and friendly.
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Kwong L,5.0,"We stayed for 5 days at the Phoenix and were really impressed by all aspects of the hotel. It is centrally and conveniently located and excellent value for money.  Hotel staff at Reception and the Restaurant were exceptional in their warmth and welcome, and always helpful and attentive; they always have a friendly smile and nothing was too much. They even packed us breakfast for our early airport departure. The rooms are excellent - beautifully decorated, very comfortable and spacious (the Deluxe), clean and had everything one needs for a holiday stay.   The Phoenix is a heritage hotel - its decor beautiful and tasteful (not glitzy like other 4* or 5* hotels) which makes sitting in the lobby or reading room, or open-spaced restaurant very restful. The whole place felt very spacious, with long corridors and open courtyards. Breakfast has a wide and sumptuous spread of local Asian and Western choices, and a good selection of fruit and juices to start the day. The restaurant menu is very good and reasonably priced.  We were treated to a tour of the hotel, given a talk of its historical significance - the older, original part of interesting architectural value - and its pride in housing Soekarno's office when Yogya was briefly capital of Indonesia.  All in all, I recommend the Hotel Phoenix totally. Stay there if you are going to Yogya."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"This hotel is really beautiful, with history and atmosphere. Although the hardware is old, it is well maintained and the bath water is very large!The kids loved the pool and there were very few people.We stayed for two nights and the breakfast was very rich every day. There would be new dishes and they would not be completely repeated. It’s so nice to sit outside and have breakfast!"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Maja G.,4.0,"A great location, with comfortable beds.  The staff were brilliant, they exceeded our expectations. The only thing that really needs improving is the food.  There really is too much choice at breakfast and not not enough quality ingredients. It's as if the hotel is trying to cater for absolutely eventuality without doing it well enough.  Lots of processed food, sugar and not enough fresh, quality ingredients."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Aidah S,5.0,"We booked at Phoenix Hotel for 3 nights. |We arrived on 20 April 2024, checked in very late about 2am. Front desk was very helpful.|Our first night room, the room toilet's flush system was not very good so we requested for a change of room.  The hotel was very kind to accommodate the room change.|We were also very happy with the breakfast selection and the service staff Shendy was friendly and helpful.|We will definitely consider this hotel for our next trip."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Overall, the hotel's decoration looks high-grade and comfortable. The layout is beautiful and has a sense of history. It's worth staying. But the hot water kettle in the room is broken, and points will be deducted for small details. Also, it may be because the sound insulation is not very good. In the morning, the cleaning staff frequently opened and closed other rooms to clean and rest. I couldn't help but check out early. Could it be that the staff was in a bad mood and behaved rudely?"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Marior Kosovi,5.0,"Greetings!

The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Jonathan W,5.0,Welcoming staff: They really couldn't do enough for us. And they enjoyed playing with our three-year-old. || Central location: Very quick to access the main sites. ||Generous breakfast: Great spread. And also a decent restaurant for lunch and dinner. ||Happy Times!
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,4.5,"There are different opinions on the Internet. The good ones are praised to the heavens, while the bad ones are called Internet celebrities. Personally, it feels good, a humanistic hotel. The facilities are definitely a bit old, but acceptable. Glass bottled water, environmentally friendly. The breakfast was very good, with rich dishes and a good dining environment. In addition, the location is okay, but it is still a bit far from the train station and requires a taxi."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"When booking the room in advance, I stated that it was a wedding anniversary, so the decoration was grand. Thank you for your thoughtfulness! The hotel has a strong Indonesian historical style, and there are many historical objects placed in the corridors, which make people feel nostalgic for the past and lament that time flies and life is short! The front desk staff are warm and friendly, always greeting you with a smile, making you feel at home; those friendly smiles when we meet during the trip are always unforgettable!"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Anne Wil Stegeman,5.0,"Our stay in The Phoenix Hotel was absolutely memorable. Everything was just perfect. Ghita and Shendy, we really appreciate how you made our 3 year old son feel at home being so far away from home (Holland). Great thank you"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,See fei,4.0,"Nice building and decoration with good service from the staffs. The rooms were a bit dated. The towels were clean but aged, time to change. The teapot in the room was weird. Other than that all is well."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Reiko K,5.0,"In any sorts aspect this was an excellent place to stay. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. We enjoyed long breakfast with so many variety of cuisine. Historical tour inside of the hotel made our stay very  special, too. Thank you!|(They made packed breakfast for my early start journey specifically which was so tasty!)"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Awesome hotel. Classic and excellent hotel. From decoration to service, it is impeccable.I especially like the hotel's furniture. The service is also very good. It's also very close to the city center. It's very cheap to download the taxi app.Breakfast is also good, especially the swimming poolHotel waiters, every one of them is smiling"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Sharon Simpson,3.0,"Positives - Public spaces really nice full of antiques and very nice colonial vibe. Pool was lovely and surprisingly quite cool. Hotel was quiet given we were in the middle of the city which was a big bonus. The hotel is quite central and near various restaurants and malls. Good coffee shop round the corner. Room was nice but a bit dated. The rooms need spruced up for the price. We paid £100 per night for pool view and £160 for Exec room. For Indonesia this is very expensive and I would not say the hotel was 5* and our room certainly wasn’t worth the cost as it was small. I wouldnt pay the extra for an Exec room.  The hotel provided a robe and slippers which was a nice touch. The staff were friendly and tried to be helpful and they kindly made some pandan pancakes for us which we all loved. Breakfast was ok but we thought it would be better to focus on fewer options and higher quality.

Negatives - We booked this hotel for a meeting. The communications with the manager were very poor before arrival and just as bad when we arrived. Our Project Manager repeatedly asked to speak to the manager or for them to call but this didn’t happen. On day one we had to search for staff to ask questions etc. The service was not good. Although on future dates after complaining we did have a member of staff assigned to us. Bar was a bit drab we preferred sitting in the lounge area. The beer was very expensive - more than the very fancy Renaissance we stayed in Bali! Cleanliness of room was ok but not great and the patterned coverlet on our bed was really stained which didn’t give a good impression. The sofa and chairs were also stained and sofa had holes in it.  So all in all would I stay again. Probably not."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The staffs are friendly. The check-in and check-out process were simple and hassle-free. Room is cozy and comfortable. Hotel location is great, not very far from the famous shopping street. The breakfast was okay but the meals that we ordered for lunch were very salty and oily for us."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The first night we stayed in Indonesia was very nice. Sitting on the balcony, blowing the wind, chatting, and eating fruit, I instantly felt like I was on vacation. The room is not big, but some small decorations are quite nice. The hotel is quite large, with many wood carvings and porcelain displays, and a rich variety of plants. It is highly recommended."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,4.0,"Western-style historical building in the city center. Booking in advance is good value for money. I can extend my stay in the suite on New Year's Eve. It's so expensive. I was shocked when I turned on the bath water. I think the pipes need to be cleaned. Bottled water is in limited supply. The curtains fell down. It was all an adventure. The breakfast is rich, but it can’t be served when there are too many people. The pool view is worth staying."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Gill Westaway,4.0,"A beautiful hotel, full of charm, a true heritage hotel. and a superb buffet breakfast was included in the room rate. My only complaints were that fruit juices on the otherwise impeccable breakfast buffet would be so much nicer if made from fresh fruit. I also found it unnecessary  for staff to remove my swimming costume from where it was lying on my swimming towel outside my room with no indication to me as to where it had been taken. Little details that spoiled an otherwise perfect stay!"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Paula M,5.0,"It was a business trip but I was also accompanied by family. I have stayed at this wonderful hotel several times before. Not only is it a beautiful hotel, the staff are exceptional and the food is excellent. Make sure you get a room or suite with balcony overlooking the pool."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,laniaa Anjlii,5.0,"The hotel's design is unique, with a wide range of history in it. The service was also excellent, especially the receptionist . Room cleanliness is also excellent, plus a very strategic location. Close to tourist attractions and food centers"
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Faisal Alsaleh,5.0,"My 3rd days @ The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - MGallery 😇
I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - MGallery and I must say, the experience was exceptional, largely thanks to the wonderful receptionist, Jejeeyy. She effortlessly took care of my reservation, ensuring I got a good rate, and even arranged transportation from the airport to the hotel. Her local knowledge was invaluable; she recommended the breathtaking Parangtritis sunset and the bustling Malioboro Street, enhancing my Jogja city exploration.

A special shoutout also goes to the head chef, Mr. Bayu. Every morning during breakfast, he went above and beyond to ensure we had a delightful dining experience, helping us select from a fantastic array of dishes.

The entire staff was incredibly friendly and always wore smiles, making me feel right at home. Thanks to everyone at The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta for making my stay memorable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Yogyakarta!
Thanks

I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - MGallery and was thoroughly impressed with the overall experience. The hotel exudes elegance and charm, seamlessly blending heritage and modernity. The rooms were luxurious, the amenities top-notch, and the ambiance truly captivating.

A highlight of my stay was the exceptional service provided by the bartending staff, Felin and Tri. Their friendly demeanor and infectious enthusiasm added a unique flair to the hotel experience. Not only were they attentive and professional, but they also went above and beyond to make guests feel welcome and entertained.

Felin and Tri's jovial nature made interactions feel more like catching up with old friends rather than typical hotel service. Their sense of humor and quick wit had us laughing and joking throughout our time at the bar. It was evident that they genuinely enjoyed their work and took pride in ensuring guests had a memorable experience.

One aspect that stood out was their genuine interest in engaging with guests. They always took the time to ask what we would like to drink, offering recommendations and engaging in delightful conversations. Their personalized approach and warm hospitality truly set them apart.

In conclusion, The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - MGallery exceeded my expectations in every aspect, and much of that credit goes to the outstanding service provided by Felin and Tri. Their commitment to excellence, combined with their friendly and jovial nature, made our stay truly unforgettable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Yogyakarta and looking for a luxurious and memorable experience."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Stay is good, in room dining last order is way past midnight. Quiet neighbourhood. Room i have is king bed but it's actually 2 single bed pushed together."
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Daniel Navarro Lorenzo,5.0,"""Staying at this hotel was an enchanting experience, thanks to its stunning architecture and attention to detail. The swimming pool, patios, reception, and hall areas were particularly impressive and transported you to another era. However, I couldn't help but notice that the rooms could use some renovation soon. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend this hotel for its unique charm and ambiance."""
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Yuliana Natsir,5.0,I can feel the sense of Jogja in the past in this beautiful hotel. The furniture and decoration are the combination of old Jogja and dutch. The staff are amazingly polite and helpful. Staying in this hotel is a wonderful experience.
The Phoenix Hotel Yogyakarta - Handwritten Collection,Laura Carballo,5.0,"Amazing hotel with colonial style.  it's a pleasure just to walk around and discover every corner. Super professional staff, super nice all of them and great great food. A must in Yogjakarta."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.5,"The location is really good, 10 minutes walk from the train station. It is the busiest area on Mario Street, next to a big shopping mall, but it is not noisy at all because the window faces the alley. The room is a standard domestic all-seasons hotel, clean and comfortable, and the staff can respond well to the needs of guests. The drinks and snacks in the refrigerator are free and are refreshed every day. The breakfast is quite rich, completely beyond the standard of a three-star hotel. There are all kinds of shops, convenience stores, and restaurants downstairs. Starbucks is across the street, and the price is only half of that in China. This time, because I go out early and come back late every day, I booked their place, which is more suitable for travelers who don't stay in hotel rooms for a long time."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,S W,4.0,"Good location, clean rooms, pleasant staff. Breakfast buffet has good quantity but food is low quality items. Almost no cheese, no oats or porridge, no yoghurt, coffee on one day was undrinkable, juices are mostly water with syrup.  You can live off it but it is not nice. Go to karta cafe next door for much better food and the Malio Gelato across the street is very good. But aside from food, all was good, staff was so polite and helpful!"
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,shah d,5.0,"Stayed at ‘Tidy’ room with balcony. Organized birthday party.. Thumbs up to Sales Marketing, Ms Dewanti & the team, F&B Pak Ichuk & the team for making my stay a memorable one. I must say that all my requests were kept in mind and fulfilled perfectly. Staff were friendly & always with their lovely smile..Well done.. Always have nice cappuccino at Kala Jumpa cafe. Conveniently and easy access for shopping..Tq very much…🙏🏻👍🏻"
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,idris C,1.0,"1. Poorly Trained Staff: The hotel staff lacked proper training and professionalism. When we arrived around 1:00 PM, they rudely informed us that check-in was only possible after 3:00 PM. Their attitude left a negative impression.||2. High Price: Considering the issues we encountered, the hotel’s pricing felt unreasonably high.||3. Lack of Customer Service: The hotel manager should prioritize customer satisfaction and be willing to compromise. Unfortunately, this was not the case at Aveta Hotel Malioboro.||In summary I was going to stay 2 more nights but due to the poor treatment and subpar conditions, my companions and I decided to book elsewhere. I hope the hotel management takes steps to improve their service quality and guest experience."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Andree Boehme,5.0,"The Aveta Hotel which is located directly at the Malioboro street is a good choice for a nice stay. It has a little Coffee Bar in the ground floor. The reception is in the 8th floor where also the pool is. It has a nice flair and charm. The rooms are well furnished and clean. The Service is excellent, esp for Laundry and Room Service. The breakfast has a good variety of Food and Drinks. Due to the Hotel is located directly at the Malioboro street you can stroll along the road, which has many Bars, Shops and Restaurant. Also a big Mall is directly next to the Hotel, where you can buy things of Daily need. An Alfamart is also not far away for grocery. I just can suggest it! If i ever will come back i would stay here again, for sure."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Margareta A,5.0,"I visit the caffe at the ground floor and its name is Kala Jumpa. the service is good, and the staffs are very nice and helpful. The place was cozy and have a nice ambiance, their interior looks modern and feels convenient. the access is easy to find."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Wen Li J,5.0,"The room was clean and nice, everything needed is provided. I love how the hotel gave us a free welcoming gifts too. It's so convinient that the hotel is located at the malioboro street. Would recommend my friends to stay here when they're having a trip in jogja."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Tour40228972357,5.0,"very strategic hotel, in the center of the malioboro street crowd, spacious comfortable rooms, varied and delicious breakfast. i recommend this hotel when coming to yogyakarta. The staff hospitality is great, especially for the receptionist."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The location in the middle of Malioboro is strategic for those bringing the family... but for those who want to go in and out, access is a bit difficult... Clean hotel, good facilities... it's just a shame that you still have to have a cash deposit before checking in... it's like a budget hotel...! the rest is great..."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,GoPlaces02026798339,4.0,"best hotel in near malioboro street, we hope internet accest more usefully and breakfast more diverse. The bed is using king koil, making my sleep better, |There are few problems related to the police of the city goverment, which every time you enter or leave the hotel at 18;00 - 21;00 you can'T enter or leave the hotel by car"
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,erica dewi,4.0,"The room is big and very nice, the service was very good and many options for breakfast. The location very good because it’s just beside the mall. The lack of this hotel is the swimming pool that seems dirty and not well maintained"

Aveta Hotel Malioboro,rashidah hafiz,5.0,"We arrived the hotel around 10am and we had to leave our bags at the receptionist area and only allowed to check in at 3pm. But they did mention that they will Whatsapp us if our rooms were ready earlier and they did text me around 120pm  but we were at another mall to have our lunch and to get our toiletries.

The rooms we had were spacious and interconnecting rooms as per request. They gave us 2 access cards each. AC was very good. Good tv selection.
There's a kettle, 2 pairs of bedroom slippers. The minibar was not very cold. The toilet has a bidet and rainshower has good water pressure and good temperature to ur liking. They do provide iron and ironing board too.

The pool and reception is on the 7 or 8 floor. The alley to the hotel carpark is very narrow so most of the time we had to book Grab near Indomaret store near to the main road. Very convenient to shop around and the mall is right next to the hotel! Fyi, the main road at Malioboro street is closed between 6-9pm for horse rides, rickshaws and pedestrian to roam around.

The hotel is 10-15 mins away from Yogyakarta train station but the road outside the station is very rough and abit difficult to walk with heavy luggages. Once u reach the shops at Malioboro st, no issues to walk with the luggage."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Gab Travel Diary,5.0,Overall good experiences. Staff was helpful. Booked quadruple room and the room was huge. The room was clean and tidy. Things to improve: breakfast. Breakfast was cold and few things needs to be improved.
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,ichzan muh,4.0,"friendly service even though it's midnight when your concentration is definitely unstable, easy access and close to entertainment venues, complete food for all domestic and foreign groups"
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Evelin E,3.0,Location is right on the centre of iconic Malioboro. Just bear in mind that the main road is closed every day from 6-9pm for motorcycles or cars. The entrance to the hotel is via an alley (that can accommodate 1 car comfortably at one time).
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Chiax0ra,5.0,"Highly recommended if you wanna stay in Jogja, near to the train station.
Next to shopping mall.
If you like shopping for batik, here's the perfect area.

Good rooms, smells amazing the hallways, rooms.
Nice ambience. Friendly staff.

Variety breakfast even if you are vegan.

Also big plus because next to the hotel ; Mall Malioboro, they have vegan restaurants in the food court level 3.

So if you are vegan, just book this hotel :)"
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,luvfeelin 乐飞翎 (乐飞翎),5.0,"The hotel is located on the busiest Malioboro street. The location is very convenient. The price for a 4-person room is also very reasonable. The room is large and comfortable. It's a pity that the room is right under the swimming pool on the roof, and the sound of drainage can be heard every day. The buffet breakfast here is the same almost every day, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Andi Yana,4.0,Great location as it is in the central of malioboro. Many shops and food around the area. Everything was great but if possible do provide extra small towel such as facial towel. Breakfast has variety but not that tasty.
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,chin wey ngee,4.0,"Situated @ the old town of malioboro.  Very busy & congested area.  Heavy human traffic even on monday nite.  Room is acceptable @ the booking rate, free minibar & refill everyday but cleaner towel is better.  Bed is huge with comfy pillow & mattress.  BF is quite tasty with many variety to choose from.  Indon chili is excellent.  Chk in  is @ lvl8 with welcome drink, also where pool is located.  L1 is comfy drinking area facing main road.  Many cafe & convenient store within walk distance."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Melina Malik,5.0,"All good and great!! Location, the food, services.. Very helpful too... Friendly staff.. Would recommend the hotel to others... Long stay or short stay is recommended.. Will stay here again for sure.. Thank you so much Aveta much love from Malaysia"

Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The hotel's location couldn't be better. Smack in the center of Malioboro. Just beside a mall and there is a 24-hour pharmacy really close by for any medication should the need arise. The rooms are all recently renovated. Still has the ""new"" feel. We booked a car from the hotel to Candi Borobudur. An excellent trip in all."
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Ayu Sartika,5.0,"It was a great accommodation to stay. Clean, tidy, complete supplies and equipment. Comfortable room and humble staff. Awesome experience in this hotel."

Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"A recommended hotel for those looking for a location around Malioboro, the cafe terrace is directly on the Malioboro sidewalk, the location is next to Malioboro Mall. The deluxe room is quite spacious, namely 24m2. The breakfast menu has many variations and is delicious. There is a swimming pool on the rooftop for children and adults. The car park is through a rather narrow alley, but there are officers who will help direct you"
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,nidoalfonso,5.0,"good place, with best option at location in the right price, side by side with mall, so business, pleasure is met, no need to worry about food and other necessities, because next to us is malioboro plaza.."

(1) Location: very centralized location (a minute walk to the main nuzzling street for shopping and market)
(2) wonderful and caring service by the hotel staffs. I want to especially mention Aulia at the front desk. Her attentiveness and professionalism has made our stay wonderful here.
(3) Good breakfast spread"
Aveta Hotel Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The hotel is located in the heart of Malioboro, convenience and clean. Breakfast is good too. The only thing is malioboro street will close from 6 pm to 9 pm daily, cars can’t go in, a bit inconvenience"
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Enjoy the holidays during staying in this hotel. The service is good and fast response when we got trouble with air conditioner. Food is delicious.

Rooms feel cozy and homey, cleanliness is number one!
Strategic location in the heart of malioboro, easy access to public transport, food, and attractions

Room service is affordable and various. (Nachosnya sering sold out 😭)

Staffs are friendly and helpful.

One thing you can't miss in the hotel is their breakfast 🥰 love the service and menu that changes everyday~

Overall, price is worthit to what they offer!
Will definitely come back here!
Left a piece of my heart here ❤️"

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,rustam bachtiar,5.0,"Had a wonderful stay here April 2024. The receptionist and all the stafs including the resto team during breakfast were very kind & helpful.
Hotel & room looks well maintained and clean."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Trip.com Member,4.5,"It’s more lively when going out. The hotel includes breakfast, and the breakfast is quite rich. Putting two beds together is suitable for family travel."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Bimo Bayuaji,2.0,Have book the hotel few weeks before for 2 rooms. We request connecting room but they give us opposite rooms. When we arrive at 3 PM they even havent start to clean our other rooms. The RECEPTION TEAM really show a passive and slow response on giving us update on when our room will be ready. Kudos to the front office manager that promise to clean the room in less than 15 minutes and deliver on tine. Grand Zuri need to understand their staffing capacity in high season as well as training their front office/reception how to handle complain.
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Dei Dei,5.0,"Happy to stay at this hotel. The hotel is clean, the room is bright (highly important for me). The location is near Malioboro street and Tugu Station. Happy to stay here."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Briantab Tab,1.0,"1. Bad checking experience, the male front desk doesnt seem to have been trained in service industry whatsoever, he keep changing my order non smoking to smoking, double bed to twin bed. Lucky the lady next to him take over and CAN get the room as per my order. Dont know what get into him

2. Room is smelly and need a refurnish

3. Can get my breakfast because it eas super full, the staff didnt event bothered to help me. She just stand and do nothing even after i nudge her several time

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Abdul Hamid,5.0,"Alhamdulillah, it was a very pleasant experience for 2 days visiting the city of Yogya and staying at one of the best hotels close to Jalan Malioboro. The staff are friendly and the food menu is extensive and delicious. I won't forget it. If you travel by train, it only takes about 5 minutes from the hotel to Tugu Station. I chose the Grand Deluxe room which was clean and comfortable. I had a great time during my stay here. Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Helsa Patricia,5.0,"It is such a great place with a good ambiance. The staff was very nice, they treated us so great and helpful. Overall, I have a really good experience here."

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,柯學毅,3.0,"I stayed at your hotel in Yogyakarta for a few days. In fact, the waitress at breakfast was very polite and it was a good experience. However, I stayed there for three days. Only the shower gel was provided on the first day and then it was not replenished for the next two days. I didn’t know when to clean the room. Why haven't you added anything? This is a little suggestion I want to give you."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Fadhil Hentino,4.0,"+ strategic location

+ room is clean and good but not too special

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Trip.com Member,4.1,"Not bad at all. Clean and comfortable, close to the culinary center of Jogja."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Trip.com Member,4.1,Nice hotel with very friendly staff. The room little small and not too clean (sheets old and the toilet door which was glass one was little dirty. Also the shower curtain old) The room noisy as the street was very noisy Breakfast well. Staff very friendly and helpful. The value of money is ok
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Kusriniarti Dwi Lestari,4.0,Good location for strolling around malioboro and good breakfast with various of traditional dishes and snacks. Yet room wasn’t so spacious.

Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Dolive Syandious,5.0,The rooms are really good and for the breakfast they have so many food to choose and also its delicious five star for mee
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,ana purna,4.0,"5 stars for the breakfast and the housekeeping staff. they did excellent job and were always polite. most of the staff were great.

the rooms were a different story. the Grand Deluxe room was a nightmare. more expensive than 2 other types of room, yet it smelled due to humidity, because it was on pool level. you were also treated to no view but the pool tank that came up to higher than eye level. it was like staying inside an ugly aquarium. people’s dirty wet clothes were laying just outside the window, no privacy whatsoever. the hotel website was not honest about the Grand Deluxe rooms, it doesn’t show the ugly sight outside the window.

we refused the horrifying Grand Deluxe room and were ready to walk away to other hotel, luckily the management upgraded us to an Executive room. it was not luxurious, but more spacious and had a view. the rooms in general are old, even the executive room had ants on the tables. my travel agent secured a room at Melia Purosani for us to move, but i decided to stay at the Grand Zuri to show appreciation for this kind gesture of giving us a free upgrade. we stayed there for one week.

all in all the hotel offers a pleasant stay, as long as you can stay away from a Grand Deluxe room."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,rara billaa,5.0,"it's good enough, friendly waiters and u'll never bored about their dish. such a comfy zone. thank you Miss Febi and team. love itt"
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,sella M,5.0,"What can I say besides excellent! warm welcome from all staff,
great location (walking distance to Tugu train station),
spacious room (I stayed at the superior with Merapi mountain as view),
quite complete amenities,
the breakfast foods is ok but the placemnt of the food island is to narrow with the tables and foyer, and quite difficult to access to the other side when crowded,
cool gym and swimming pool.

Overall had a wonderfull experience stayed here."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,dewi kristi,5.0,"stay for 4 days 3 night so comfy and cozy place, yummy foods with may various traditionals food. overall goods"
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Eko “Rudi” Iswanto,5.0,"Be only the one for me whenever comes to jogja. The location is just a step from tugu train station. Warmed of the staffs. Nowadays, the facilities are improved a lot, named it gym and swimming pool access for me. Wanna be back soon."
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Overall, the facilities regarding our needs at the hotel were very good"
Grand Zuri Malioboro Hotel,JH Yeo,2.0,"No black out curtain, room super bright. Basic room, not worth it"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.6,"Coming back with me, my sister booked a hotel here too. He is also happy and really likes the hotel. We asked my sister to stay near my room but instead she put it in front of my room just right 😂. Everything we need is fulfilled here. Our holiday was very memorable in Malioboro. Thank you very much, sis and sir, for serving us patiently and kindly. See you again 🙏✨👍"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Jul R,1.0,"Dirty hotel room, underwear left behind the shower door which indicates housekeeping didn’t clean the room. They only send somebody from staff to remove items and didn’t bother to apologise or offer room to be cleaned again. For 4 star hotel you would expect to offer room change immediately as a minimum. Dirty bedding and dirty towels! Poor management of the service. Definitely training required for front staff to manage this kind of situation. No language barrier on this case as we speak Bhasa.
As mentioned in some other reviews super noisy train station next to the hotel so unless you don’t need to know exact schedule of passing trains DO NOT BOOK IT! You will not get a good sleep here, hotel is very basic and is  2* rather than what advertised."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.2,"This will be a very helpful review, I hope it helps you. This hotel has two shortcomings. The first is that it is very noisy, because there is a singing spot downstairs, and the speakers sing until late every day. This is not a problem with the hotel itself. The second point is very, very important, that the hotel has no heat. water. It is said that many hotels here are like this. There is no real hot water with high enough temperature. The so-called hot water is warm and a little cold. If you require hot water for bathing or washing your hair, be careful to avoid pitfalls. In terms of other conveniences, this hotel is pretty good."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Erik Nilsson,4.0,"Good location close to the train station. Which fitted us well. Rooms was okey, but it's extremely loud from the trains and prayers. The best part was the breakfast which was amazing, good selection of local food and drinks for a very good price"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.2,"It's a five-minute walk from the train station. It's surrounded by the central business district. The service is good. The front desk was unfamiliar with the business and made a little fuss. The room was basically at the level of a guest house and was quite noisy. I checked the room and found it unacceptable. I immediately booked another hotel. , four-day orders cannot be canceled long ago. It is a waste of time. 4.3 points is more objective. I give 4.2 points."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.5,"The hotel location is quite strategic. In the Malioboro area and close to the train station. The train noise was very clearly audible to KNR, quite disturbing. It's not difficult to find but eat. There are lots of hotels around and it's open until evening. Clean rooms, friendly waiters. Very comfortable hotel."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.5,"I enjoyed my stay in this hotel . This was my first time in Yogyakarta and as a solo female traveler I wanted to make sure safety is priority.The hotel is just minutes walk to the train station that takes you directly to airport and to hotel. Was a breeze going in and out. You have to book train ticket prior Incase it gets booked up. The room was adaquent, spacious and location plenty of restaurant around and coffee place. A min walk to main street. I felt very safe. Thanks"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.7,"There were no accommodations like this near Malioboro, so we immediately extended our stay for one more night... It was popular because there were a lot of locals and it was cheap and clean... If you don't like local food, it would be better to skip the breakfast."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,efendy Isa,4.0,Nice hotel. Near to everything food cafe shopping. Can check in anytime. Breakfast also good. Variety of indonesian drinks. Luv it
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Farah Amalia,5.0,"The room was okay, the service was amazing (the staff were friendly ), and the breakfast buffet was excellent. The location was great but the train horns were something else you needed bare 😅"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,5.0,All facilities such as Maglio Boro Street and the bus terminal and subway station are nearby.It's easy to move to other areas and you can easily go to Malioboro Street in the evening.
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,ladyrain12,2.0,"The hotel has a great location opposite train station which is very convenient if you take train to airport. We booked this hotel for that reason due to next morning we had morning flight and took train to airport at 4.20am. |The room very decent, hairdryer was only by request not provided in the room, no shampo and soap eventough the tubes are there but empty 😅|That time our room view was train station which very noisy from the sound of train and information made by the train staff🥲 lucky that time we were very very tired so we managed to sleep. But for those light sleeper better avoid the hotel. |the hotel only walking distance to malioboro st. The room was clean. |The staffs were not friendly during my stay."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Michael Muhammad,3.0,"The sink was clogged up, not good. Service was good. Overall, recommend."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,5.0,The location of the hotel is very affordable to Malioboro.... Recommended for children because it has a view of the station (you can see the trains)
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.1,"The facilities are relatively old, a bit like a guest house in the 1990s, but the room is very clean and the price is acceptable. The biggest problem is that it's next to the train station and it's so noisy that I basically can't sleep without wearing earplugs, but the hotel doesn't have them, so you need to bring them. Next to it is Mario Pineapple Street, which is very convenient for going out for a stroll. The entrance is a one-way street, so taking a taxi will be troublesome. Anyway, if you can just transfer to Yogyakarta and stay there, and you have two more days to play, I wouldn’t recommend it."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.7,"I want to stay here temporarily for one night. The restaurant here is not bad, but I didn't add breakfast because there are too many delicious foods here, and the attitude of the service staff is very good. It's just that some accidents happened in the shower gel in the toilet, which caused The shower gel couldn't be squeezed out, so we were given a new room immediately after responding to the counter. The service is really great! You can try it if you have a chance, but it is true that the sound insulation is not good. After all, it is next to the train station, but the scenery outside the window is so beautiful, you can see the volcano🤤"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Mark Schoen,1.0,"Extremely loud and they don’t even offer ear plugs. So silly!! It’s not like the train appeared. Also, the windows are single paned so it is constantly loud. Also, there is no drinking water refill station like most hotels. They want you to buy more tiny bottles of water. I would not recommend staying here"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Adi Yudistira,5.0,"Nice hotel room with best location. Really close to Tugu Train Station and many other tourist spot. Malioboro street is just steps away from the lobby.
We made a mistake regarding the bedding type upon booking which we chose twin-bed. The Reception (lady) quickly offered bedding switch to king bed and we really appreciate his action 🙏"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Dorothea Cindy,1.0,"Staying here for 2 night. Hotel staff's service was really good and fast check in.

Not recommended for people who hard to sleep. Noise from outside even music from across the street could clearly heard from room. Dirty towel and blanket. Bathroom design with separate toilet and shower, and open washtafel made the room humid and smelly. What was the designer think when he designed this hotel's layout. Very poor layout arrangements.

10PM now, and i started to regret my decision to stay here because of the loud music from outside. Sorry but I'd say that i wouldn't recommend nor stay in this hotel for the second time. Even though the service was really nice."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.7,"Hotel is in poor state of repair.  We asked for hairdryer, they provided a broken one that looks risky to use.  We complained and they provided a proper unit.The kettle provided in the room is also dangerous to use, you could get your hand burnt to hold the handle. The towers provided are obviously old and yellowish.The rooms are small but functional.The lobby smells due to poor sewage system.The plus point is the Service Staff, like most in Yogdakarta, they are very nice."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The hotel is about ten meters away from malioboro street, across the road is the railway station, the transportation is convenient, and it is also a hot spot for tourist attractions. It is also within walking distance to the Sultan Palace and Water Palace. The hotel facilities are okay, cost-effective, quiet, you can ask for accommodation not to face the train station."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,3.0,"Had requested a room max on the 2nd floor but apparently got a room on the 9th floor, told to wait until finally allowed to enter the room at 14.30 even though I brought a baby but couldn't hurry up"
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,A.L.,3.0,"The location of this hotel is excellent, literally across the street from the main train station and just steps from Jl. Malioboro, the main commercial street of Yogyakarta. The staff are also quite friendly.

The room though was thoroughly mediocre. The chair was filthy and covered in stains. The window blinds were literally disintegrating as I used them. The air conditioning barely worked. It was set at 16C but was only outputting at 25C. The bed and bathroom facilities were fine though. There was a lot of noise from the corridor from other guests and the cleaning staff. I only stayed here for one night before going to a different hotel."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Erica NMC,5.0,It's nearby train station. Staff are friendly and helpful. Room service was good too. Didn't expect much from the room cleanliness. There's a stain here and there. Overall still good.
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,Trip.com Member,4.0,Good location. Near to train station yogya. Lots of shops and cafe . Room size just ok for 2 people. Nothing fancy. Breakfast also ok. Varieties and lots of food
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,GunBali,3.0,"Located on walking distance from Tugu Train station. It is ideal place to stay when arrive on train.   It is also very close to center of attraction Malioboro Street and Keraton.   The hotel is new (was not there on my last visit to Yogya).  The place is generally clean.||||Do not expect to have good view here.   When you're on elevator you can see untidy roof of neighbouring house.     We ask for some information from staff in reception about local attraction, to our surprise they can not give sufficient answer.  I guess the hotel need to familiarise their staff on what's happening around their hotel (where the cafe with good music, where is the busking area etc etc).||||There is spa flyer in the room, when we call for spa service, the staff said it only available after 18:00 hrs (we call at 16:00).     Then we decide to search for outside spa which then come to the hotel.   Later that evening the staff called and willing to give a promo for 10 minutes shoulder and back massage.    Then we found out that they have a mutual contract with outside spa and actually they can be called at any time (not necessarily wait for 18:00).     It is a simple 'laziness' from the staff to say it is available at 18:00.  She should had called their spa partner first before giving un-favourable answer.||||Should you stay in this hotel ?   YES, if the good points described above match your requirement.||NO, if you look for more  peaceful place, with warmer staff attitude."
Malioboro Prime Hotel Yogyakarta,ontheroadagainva,3.0,"Great location!  The hotel is located across from the train station which actually has a number of simple eating places and a minimart. Malioboro walking street is only a block away. It is packed at night with locals and tourists out to see and be seen.  There is a mall on Malioboro street about 4 blocks away with a number of simple places to eat and a grocery store. Grab is always available and can take you anywhere in town for a few $US.  The room price was about $33 per night with breakfast included.||||Being across from the train station, the horns on the trains woke me up multiple times each night.  The bed was comfortable, the TV was good, the shower had decent pressure, but the toilet had a smell.  Towels and sheets were stained and showed their age.  The hotel will only give you one key, so if you have two or more independent persons staying here, room access would be a headache.  The is no mini-fridge.||||I saw no other non-indonesians except me staying here.  Front desk personnel spoke English but limited.||||Seating at breakfast was way too limited for the number eating, and several times when I went back for more I returned to find people seated at my table and unable to communicate because of language.  I just sat in any empty spot and continued eating which freaked them out although they pretended to not see me sitting there. || The restaurant staff spoke no English at all so ordering eggs or drinks was tough, and I did not get what was desired a lot.||||The lobby, elevators, and hallways were clean and modern.  I like this hotel and may stay here again based on the location and bed comfort, but will likely skip the breakfast and ask for better towels and sheets upon check-in.||||I will post a picture of the horribly stained chair in the room which I just covered with one of the stained towels."

The food at the hotel restaurant was delicious, offering a variety of fresh and flavorful dishes for breakfast and dinner.

Our room was comfortable and well-equipped with all necessary amenities, including toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, and a coffee/tea maker. The bed was clean and cozy, ensuring a restful sleep.

The highlight for our kids was the pool access. The pool had a safe and accessible ladder, allowing them to enjoy swimming without worry. They had a great time and always looked forward to going back.

Overall, staying at The 101 Yogyakarta Tugu was an unforgettable experience for our family. We highly recommend this hotel for its excellent service, tasty food, well-equipped rooms, and child-friendly facilities. Thank you, The 101 Yogyakarta Tugu, for a wonderful vacation!"
THE 1O1 Yogyakarta Tugu,Fajar A,4.0,"One of many delightful options to stay close to the Tugu Yogyakarta. It's close to interesting places like shops, restaurants, and cafes.

THE 1O1 Yogyakarta Tugu,Ray March Syahadat,4.0,All I can say is their location is so strategic in the middle heart of Yogyakarta. So close with Tugu Yogyakarta as the part of cosmological axis that become UNESCO world heritage site.

THE 1O1 Yogyakarta Tugu,Dave,2.0,Rooms are really a nightmare. Loud and furniture was damaged everywhere. Bathroom dirty and towels stank like they were not fresh. We liked the location of the hotel.
THE 1O1 Yogyakarta Tugu,Amanda,4.0,"I did 5 nights in this hotel with a pool view.
The room was nice and clean. The points of improvement is the fridge which was quite dirty and not cold at all. My room was connected by a closed door to my neighbour and i could hear him talking clearly. Other than that i really appreciated my stays.

The breakfast was really good and the hotel provided us a lot of variety of food.

The hotel is in the Tugu area very very close to Malioboro."
THE 1O1 Yogyakarta Tugu,indah nia,5.0,"one of the recommended hotels in Yogyakarta which is located very close to the Tugu. hotelnya bersih, breakfastnya banyak macam dan enak semua. the hotel staff is also friendly and helpfull. special thanks to Mbak Rani (the hotel staff) for the special dessert dan ngobrol2nya👍"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,H. Breux,5.0,"We loved our stay at Royal Malioboro by Aston. We stayed for 2 nights at the start of our honeymoon in Indonesia and were impression by the great service of the staff, especially the kind waiter that helps on the rooftop bar and speaks excellent  English.

The location next to the city’s main artery (Malioboro) and in front of Yogyakarta main station is super convenient, however it comes at a price: loud train noises day and night that the windows of our room did little to prevent. Small issue really but worth noting I’m case you are a light sleeper!

Amenities are great with lovely rooftop pool and brand new gym. Spa is also very good according to my wife who had a 90min massage there.

Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Yogyakarta looking for a luxury, comfortable hotel with all the amenities.

Thank you again!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Rowan H,5.0,"Stayed here for 4 nights on a recent visit to Yogyakarta with my wife.||Pros|- Location - it’s right in the heart of the action adjacent to Jalan Malioboro and Jalan Sosrowijayan which feature most of your restaurants and shopping. All easy walking distance. In addition it’s directly opposite the train station (Stasion Tugu). This means we were able to get the train directly from the airport to the hotel rather than getting a taxi (I believe it was about 20000IP each for train tickets). This is the cheapest and fastest method to get to the hotel. You can walk from the train station maybe 300m to the hotel. It’s the tallest building in Yogyakarta so you shouldn’t miss it. We also jumped on the train to go onwards to Surabaya so it offered a great onwards connection. |- Rooms - Rooms were air conditioned and clean with comfortable beds. |- Value - We paid about 70000IP a night although we came during a quiet period in Ramadan. I think this is actually considered quite expensive for Indonesian standards but given the high standards of the hotel I felt it was very reasonably priced. This hotel appeared to be the most upmarket in Yogyakarta.|- Staff were very friendly and greeted us warmly whenever we left or returned from a day outside. We found the bartender upstairs, Aldo to be particularly helpful and wanted to give him a shout out. |- Wifi worked well|- Had a rooftop pool which was kept clean and offered views over to gunung merapi on a clear day. |- Had a rooftop bar adjacent to the pool for beverages and food. This was helpful as being a Muslim territory alcohol can be tricky to acquire sometimes. |- The gym although modest had enough equipment to get a reasonable workout. Free weights up to 12kg and a well maintained combination machine plus a treadmill and bike.|- Filtered cold and hot water available in the corridors (you can’t drink water out of the tap here). ||Cons|- Although the location opposite the train station was convenient for onwards travel the station did run 24/7 and there was a bit of noise from the trains in the middle of the night. I think this could prove problematic if you’re a light sleeper. |We did have some minor issues with our bathroom - toilet leaking and a bad smell when the water wand was activated rather than the shower. We advised reception of this and they did fix it same day.||Overall we enjoyed our time here and would have no issues recommending it to others."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Putri HS,5.0,"Had a very nice time at the hotel. Very affordable, close by all essential stuff. Room is clean and quite spacious for the price. Good varieties of breakfast. Additional plus point for the cozy rooftop, special shout out to Mas Aldo, always lovely and cheerful. Will definitely come back."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Myesha Zara,5.0,"threw an event here and it was worth it, even it was worth every penny. i just love the services here, if i could rate it the score would be 100/10. also everyone here were so kind and polite. food was good, but couldve been better. overall so great to have Royal Malioboro by ASTON as the place to throw your event, you wont be disappointed!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Ezaruddin Abd Rahman,5.0,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was large with a very comfortable bed. Front desk were very accommodating, spoke some English to my benefit and helped us with everything. Front desk , Mr Dimas very helpful . Nearby to train station and malioboro road for shopping"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The location of the hotel is very good. It is across the road from the train station, which is very suitable for people who have to catch the train to the airport early in the morning. Next door is Malioboro Street, which is convenient for shopping and eating in the evening. I booked a suite. In fact, the so-called suite is only 33 square meters, but it is quite spacious visually. The advantage is that the price is relatively cheap and matches the price. Breakfast is on the second floor and starts at 6 o'clock. The variety is super rich and there are many local specialties. It is very delicious! The only dissatisfaction is that bottled water is not provided."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Rio Indralaksono,4.0,"This is one of the best hotels in a great location.  The breakfast is good enough for a 4 star hotel. The Deluxe room is also spacious.

However, I do not recommend that you make long-term plans to stay at this hotel, especially if you are a company that needs to make detailed budgeting beforehand.  The reason is, prices at this hotel are highly volatile. Some companies may need to make sure their budget is planned accurately."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Ila S,5.0,"Location: Very convenient. Hotel located right opp. Train station. Recommended to take the train to and fro Airport as it's more convenient and faster. Not recommended if you're a light sleeper or prefer a quiet area as train horns can be heard as and when. 5-10mins walk to Jln. Malioboro for shopping, easy to find food and Mart is everywhere. |Hotel: Friendly staffs, from security, front, fnb and housekeeping staffs. I'm particular when it comes to cleanliness and the hotel room is perfectly cleaned. Breakfast spread were awesome and good food as well.|Overall: Will come back again to stay for our next visit to Jogja! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Ulfatul Maula,5.0,"Very recommended, we requested several things and all are granted (connecting rooms, not in the corner, city view).

Top notch services, all employees were very kind and would greet you in the hallway. Location is perfect, you can just cross from the Yogyakarta's Tugu train station. The hotel is also a walkable distance from Malioboro street.

The rooms are clean, great amenities, provided 3 types of towels too. There was a welcome drink of ginger tea. Water is refillable through a water filter in the hallway.

Breakfast are complete too. Western food, traditional Jogja food, Javanese desserts, all available. Taste are okay. Would recommend taking the javanese bubur desserts as our family think that this is the best menu out of all.

I'd say with this price tag, the hotel is totally worth it. Would recommend to all travelers that seek for comfort."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Annisa Rianti,5.0,"first time stayed here and this hotel didnt disappoint. the service were top notch, the staff were all so helpful and the facilities were squeaky clean from the lobby to public toilets and room were all so clean, great job!

the room were not sound proofed and there's a train station just across the building, i personally didnt mind but if you're looking for a peaceful and quiet room, this is not the hotel for you.

the breakfast was just ok. menu were varied and well curated but i took some notes... the cold cut and cheese section weren't served in a chilled plate/ chiller, so the cold cuts were not served cold and they were dry too. fix thisss come on cold cuts are supposed to be served cold.

also, for the bread section, the restaurant can do much better with the bread and jam selection. come on, the bread and jam is clearly on the cheaper and lower quality side. this also applies for the sausage, it was clearly a low quality sausage and tasted cheap.

but other food were great. great selection of salad dressing btw! loved it. coffee and jamu were great too.

for me personally, the location is great bcs it is walking distance from the train station i literally walked 2 mins from and to the station, but again, it gets loud sometimes, because.. trains.

im so coming back to stay here again."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Greg Karpo,5.0,Rooms were 5 star. Great location.  Light supper at the pool bar was good. Aldo made our supper enjoyable and offered some great tips for a true Yogyakarta experience.
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Very satisfied. In a place where most people in Indonesia are dark and small, the waitresses in this hotel are all tall and fair-skinned girls, and their service is very enthusiastic. In addition, the location is also very good. It is only a few minutes' walk from the train station and Marioboro Commercial Street. There is a convenience store and a foreign currency exchange shop downstairs. The only thing I have to fault is, first, there is something wrong with the design of the room door. It cannot close automatically, which makes me uncomfortable. I often fall asleep without closing the door. Second, don’t give away bottled water"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,4.0,Nice small hotel.  Room is clean .  Just 6 mins walk from train station .  So going to airport is so much easier compared to taxi which the traffic is crazy .  The train ride is 40min.
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Veriska Riswanda,5.0,"This afternoon, i buy some cakes ,brownies and a milk bun. it's so viral in this town, so delicious, and good price. good job Mr. satria as pastry chef. i will back in this hotel, if i back in this town."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Brian Bonaparte,5.0,"I only visited the rooftop bar so I am commenting exclusively on the amazing experience I had there with Aldo as my friendly, highly professional waiter.

The service was prompt and I was instantly made to feel comfortable, not only by Aldo, but all the staff.

This place has a great view of Yogyakarta.

I arrived for my train to Surabaya earlier than expected and luckily chose this place to cool my heals.

Completely recommend!  I bet it’s a nice place to stay overnight too!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Fita Dani,2.0,"This good really nice, the place also good……. The staff really helpful … but they mostly said No for request….. such as i boooked 7 rooms, request for 1 room to early check in and request for late check out…… THEY ALWAYS SAY NO…….. 6 from 7 rooms was really check out (at 6.00 am in the morning)
I request late check out only for 2 hours (14.00) because i need to pack many stuffs…….
We booked 7 rooms for 5 nights it’s not the cheap one……
The person i talk about is their sales team, and even not trying to meet me in real also :)…….
Just try to upgrade the customer pleasant…… maybe for many people it’s not matter, but for me its REALLY matter
Thank you"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,nella novriyanti,5.0,"Wonderful experience ever..
1. Hotel is located at premium area, near to Malioboro and easy to find food stall surrounded.
2. Staff is very helpful & friendly. Room is clean & neat. Food also tasty as well, you can find many choices for breakfast.
3. The most memorable is about met the team who shown the truly hospitality manner. Special thanks to Bu Dena, Chef Firmansyah and Pak Wisnu. Wish you all success.
4. I wanna express my hug thanks to Chef Firmansyah who made our stay  really felt like home. From the welcoming until check out. Excellence service from A to Z. And please you have to try the opera cake.

Can't wait to visit Jogya & stay again at Royal Malioboro."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Marcel Overbeek,5.0,"Really perfect hotel for you’re value. The feeling is five star , but you pay for three star.. very , very good beds and facilities. I will come again.

Marcel Overbeek the Netherlands."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Pandu Raharja-Liu,5.0,"Very strategically located right by the train station and Malioboro. Perfect if you are arriving by the train from the airport (YIA) or your Java road trip.

Staff is very helpful. My concierge, Dimas, organized an early check in for me, which was extremely helpful.

Classy modern low key interior with a lot of traditional Jogja/Javanese elements."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Son manthaboi,4.0,"A very nice and comfortable hotel just opposite Tugu train station. I booked 2 connecting rooms. Very comfortable and pristine condition. I'm a member of the archipelago group. After few bad stays in jakarta via FAVE HOTEL, gave a try to stay at Aston. Its very nice and not disappointed. Breakfast buffet was good with good choices of food, but still be improved. Wifi was good and strong.Overall ok.. I used the pool at level 9 with my children and it was great with a good train station view.

Only problem is, the stretch of road could be crazily congested during peak hours. Pls plan your airport journey to the YIA AIRPORT. Do leave to the airport early as you may miss your flight in event of any bad congestion. Hotel currently don't provide airport transfer. Book a grab or gojek and it will be costly during peak hours and wee hours to the airport.

Plenty of food choices outside and opposite. Very very close to malioboro famous shopping street and to the plaza malioboro and beringharjo Market.

Overall good stay at this hotel and will strongly recommend to my friends and family."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Wahyu Dipo Carito,5.0,"More than just the best and trusted hotel in Malioboro...!
❤️❤️❤️

Yogyakarta is always special, especially when you stay in a wright place which present and deliver more than just a good service to your craziest moments.

Royal Malioboro Hotel Yogyakarta by Aston... which was huge hotel and have a lot of rooms which can accommodate our group, and strategically located near by the Malioboro's area and close to the city train station ( for sure it makes our group members very happy... ) surprisingly prove the word of ""SPECIAL"" itself.

The hotel itself was wondering...

The rooms were homy, clean, neat, quiet and smell good. And thanks a lot to always change my towels every single days.
❤️❤️❤️

The Food and Beverages were deliciously memorable. Especially the traditional dishes ( the Gudeg and the Koyor Mercon are my favorit ).

The services were lovely heart warming.

It's such a warm help from all of the hotel staffs and management in our daily hectic schedules for the week... Especially mbak Xenna ( Sales ) and ibu Vera ( GM ) who were always more than just happy give us an assistance every time we need.

Alhamdulillah... our a week busiest event was marked as an amazing moment because of these great help and assistances.

Trust me...!!!
For your convenience stay in Yogyakarta... Royal Malioboro Hotel Yogyakarta by Aston and Neo Malioboro by Aston are the name that you can trust.
☺️👍"

I was there for a meeting.
the place is clean and neat. no need for any comments.
the prices for the fnb at the restaurant is still affordable. I ordered english bf tea for 50k I guess"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,4.5,"Location is good, breakfast is good. And it has a beautiful view on top floor. One thing need to complaint is the train strill horns in the middle of the night."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Leno Christiannaldo,5.0,"Just a perfect experience during my recent trip to Yogyakarta. I choose to stay at Royal Malioboro by ASTON.

A beautiful hotel, friendly staffs. I really enjoyed my breakfast time here. Buffet really nice lots of choice.

Great service, will be going back."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Connor McGrath,5.0,"We weren’t staying at the hotel, however, we had dinner at the rooftop and were greeted delightfully by Aldo who was our waiter for the night. He was extremely friendly, accomodating and helpful. His English was fantastic also!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,riken saputra,5.0,"we stayed on November 12th. and we had a pleasant stay here.
the rooms are clean and comfortable.
all the employees are friendly and always say hello.
The choice of food for breakfast is also varied, including traditional local food.
the location is very close to Malioboro Street and tourist and shopping attractions.
100% will come back to stay here again."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The room was clean, close to the station, about a 5-minute walk from the city center, and quiet. Another recommended point is that it also has a pool gym."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Tian Hui Ng,5.0,"Great spot! With a view of Merapi and other volcanoes in the area! Surprisingly good gnocchi too! Great relaxing spot. Aldo, our waiter was terrific too!"
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,John Healy,4.0,"This is a very comfortable hotel. Rooms are clean and well serviced. The staff are very friendly and the breakfasts are very good.

A highlight of my four day stay was to head up to the lounge on Level 9 and to be looked after by Aldo. His manner was very welcoming and his English was great. Aldo went out of his way to be of assistance- even going to the shop to purchase items for me.  You are the reason for my 5 star service rating Aldo. Thank you."
Royal Malioboro by ASTON,Fred Lee Ahfei,5.0,"Dear Aldo
I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt appreciation for the outstanding service you provided during my recent stay at Royal Malioboro. Your professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine care made my experience truly memorable"
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,2.5,"If the price is more than 200 per night, I might consider staying there. If the price is more than 300 per night, don't stay there. It's not worth it. Comparing with the standard of domestic 2.3-star economical hotels.It cost about 260 yuan to stay in a room that day, without breakfast. I asked the hotel to ask if they could give me a breakfast coupon. The hotel refused decisively and told me that if I wanted to have breakfast, I would have to pay 70 yuan (the price after converting to Indonesian rupiah). I was shocked. Lao Tie, what kind of exquisite breakfast does your family need for this price? Why do you think Chinese people look like people who have been taken advantage of? I asked if I could have free breakfast, but the front desk refused in a non-negotiable tone.At 11 o'clock the next day, the hotel called to urge me to check out. . . Help, I have never lived in anything like this. ￼To be honest, I stayed at two hotels in Yogyakarta and both of them had a very bad experience. Except for this one, the other one was also rubbish (shown in the picture)Overall, I don't recommend this hotel because there are many hotels to choose from around. Please check out more.Finally, in Yogyakarta, the hotel conditions are not as good as in Bali. Don’t have high expectations. The price here is three to four hundred a night, which is not even up to the domestic level of one or two hundred. Please lower your expectations."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"Hotel NEO is strategically located in front of Tugu Jogya station, near Maioboro, just a short walk away, the hotel is clean, the room layout is nice, neat, the bathroom is clean, the hot water is cool and the temperature is right, basically if you stay here you will definitely feel at home. Breakfast has a complete OK menu, the dining room is spacious and clean, there is air conditioning, there is a smoking room outside, breakfast at the Neo hotel is cool. If you go to Jogya, this is the recommended hotel of choice. The building is relatively new, the security receptionists are all friendly."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The hotel is in a very good location, right next to the train station. The transportation is very convenient. You can take a train directly to the hotel after getting off the plane. If you go to Surabaya, you can also get on the train from here, and it doesn't feel noisy. The breakfast was good. Surprisingly, the hotel restaurant can directly see the volcano, which is very shocking. The swimming pool is also nice."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Aryo Bimo Notohadikoesoemo,5.0,"Booking it on the site after came out from the Yogyakarta Station in a heavy downpour.
Not getting my choice of bed (that is the double one) but the FO initiatively suggested to combine the twin bed they have into one single bed....which i found it a good choice for me. The room was ready in no time. Good service indeed.

The breakfast also good. The location is just a walking distance from the Yogyakarta Train Station. Definitely will come back later"
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.1,"The room was ok in that price. But it was close to the street and was very noisy. Hard to sleep at night. Room was clean. In the hallway there were no windows, so walking from the room to the elevator was a challenge , because it stinks quite bad. But breakfast was compensating a lot. Very divers and good."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,3.7,"It's right across from Yogyakarta Train Station, so the trains are noisy. Neo has a unique ZEN atmosphere, and the cleanliness is honestly below expectations. I think the breakfast had the most variety in Jogja. Compare and if the price is affordable, I recommend it."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.5,"When I booked the hotel, Ctrip stated that the service desk had Chinese services. But when I checked in, the hotel said there were no Chinese services. The hotel front desk clerk was quite enthusiastic and used translation software to help us contact and arrange a chartered car, and was very patient. The hotel is very close to the train station. I will stay there again if I have the chance."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.5,"Best hotel with best location. Just walking distance to Malioboro St, easy access to public transport, foods and others. Facilities, services and breakfast provided was👍🏻.. i have no complaints. Would definitely recommended this hotel to others."

This is the first time I've encountered this situation. I'm speechless.The hotel is right opposite the train station, which is convenient, but the train affects rest and is not recommended."

Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,3.5,"In terms of facilities, the price is a bit expensive. Fortunately, it is close to the train station, but the street is a bit noisy at night. The breakfast is passable, but there are not many choices. It is basically the local Indonesian recipe, and I am not used to it."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"This is my second time staying at Neo Malioboro. Great location, great services, clean room, good food, and just steps away to Jogja Train Station. Recommended."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,5.0,"The location is good, diagonally opposite the Yogyakarta train station. Turn right when you go out and you will find Malioboro Street. There is a dedicated line from the train station to the airport in half an hour. There are buses on the street to Prambanan Temple (it is more convenient to come back). You can rent a car to go to the scenic spot.The room is okay. There is a water dispenser on the floor and a kettle in the room.The swimming pool is suitable for children, the breakfast is rich in variety, the service is good, and the price is high. It is worth recommending."
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Trip.com Member,4.0,"The place is cool, the rooms are also good, in the middle of the city. The service is also cool. There are lots of choices for breakfast. The main thing is really cool. Unfortunately I arrived in the middle of the night and at 12 o'clock I had to check out 😔 I'll come again next time. Thanks"
Hotel NEO Malioboro,Shantanu Dutta,5.0,"Loved this place in every. The location. Close to the railway station, I took the train and back to Yogyakarta airport and walked from the station to the hotel. The rooms are great , the staff are so polite and thoughtful and the washrooms are spotless. The breakfast buffet is great though I felt the menu was about the same every day. Tonnes of shopping and eating options and the hotel connected me to an economical taxi operator for the sight seeing. I have nothing but praise for the place"

Hotel NEO Malioboro,Darren W,5.0,"The Orion room was spacious and the bed was comfortable, especially the pillows, leading to good night's sleep. The hotel location is great, close to shops and restaurants and also the train station (ideal if you're arriving/departing Yogya by train but not if you're a light sleeper due to train horns). I highly recommend including the breakfast when booking the room, as it is exceptional value with really good local and western foods to choose from.  Housekeeping and maintenance is excellent and the tv worked as expected and included some cable channels.  I would definitely stay here again on any future visits to Yogya."
